## Core Commands

```bash
bun install                    # Initial setup
bun run lint                   # Run often - catches common errors
bun run test                   # Run frequently during development
bun run ci                     # MANDATORY before PR
```

## PR Workflow

```bash
[[ "$(git branch --show-current)" =~ ^(main|master)$ ]] && git checkout -b feature/name
# Commit format: type(scope): description
# Examples: feat(dapp): add auth | fix(contracts): overflow
```

## Critical Rules

1. NEVER commit to main
2. Edit > Create files
3. Run ALL commands from root (turborepo)
4. `bun run test` not `bun test`
5. Never discard out-of-band changes

## Core Directives

- Do EXACTLY what's asked
- â‰¤4 lines response unless detail requested
- Action > explanation
- NO unnecessary docs/README creation
