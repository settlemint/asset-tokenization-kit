# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the SettleMint Asset Tokenization Kit - a full-stack solution for
building digital asset platforms. It consists of:

- Smart contracts for various tokenized assets (bonds, equity, stablecoins,
  funds, deposits)
- A Next.js dApp with TypeScript
- TheGraph subgraph for blockchain indexing
- Kubernetes deployment via Helm charts
- End-to-end tests using Playwright

## Key Commands

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (uses Bun)
bun install

# Connect to SettleMint platform
bunx settlemint login
bunx settlemint connect

# Start local development environment
bun run dev:up            # Start Docker Compose services
bunx settlemint connect --instance local  # Connect to local instance

# Start development (predeployed contracts)
cd kit/dapp

bun deploy:remote         # Deploy to remote
bun deploy:local          # Deploy to local
bun test:integration      # Run integration tests
```

## Architecture Overview

### Smart Contract Architecture

The contracts follow the SMART protocol (v8.0.15) and implement:

1. **Factory Pattern**: Each asset type has a factory contract that deploys
   asset instances

   - `ATKBondFactory`, `ATKEquityFactory`, `ATKStableCoinFactory`, etc.
   - Located in `/kit/contracts/contracts/assets/`

2. **Proxy Pattern**: All assets use upgradeable proxies

   - Implementation contracts separate from proxy contracts
   - Enables upgradeability while maintaining state

3. **Extension System**: Modular features via extensions

   - `SMARTBurnable`, `SMARTCapped`, `SMARTCollateral`, `SMARTPausable`, etc.
   - Located in `/kit/contracts/contracts/smart/extensions/`

4. **Compliance System**: ERC-3643 compliance
   - Identity registry, trusted issuers, claim topics
   - Located in `/kit/contracts/contracts/system/`

### Frontend Architecture

1. **Next.js App Router**: Modern React with server components

   - Located in `/kit/dapp/src/app/`
   - Internationalization via `next-intl`

2. **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM

   - Schema in `/kit/dapp/src/lib/db/`
   - Hasura GraphQL layer for querying

3. **Authentication**: Better Auth library

   - Configuration in `/kit/dapp/src/lib/auth/auth.ts`

4. **Blockchain Integration**:

   - Viem for contract interactions
   - Contract addresses in `/kit/dapp/src/lib/contracts.ts`
   - Generated types from contracts

5. **State Management**:
   - SWR for data fetching
   - React Hook Form for forms
   - Server actions via `next-safe-action`

### Deployment Architecture

1. **Kubernetes**: Helm charts for deployment

   - Main chart: `/kit/charts/atk/`
   - Includes Besu blockchain, Blockscout, Hasura, TheGraph

2. **Multi-environment**: Supports staging/production deployments
   - Environment configs via `.env` files
   - CI/CD via GitHub Actions

## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development**:

   - Create feature branch from `main`
   - Run tests locally before pushing
   - PR triggers full CI pipeline

2. **Contract Changes**:

   - Modify contracts in `/kit/contracts/contracts/`
   - Run `bun test` to verify
   - Update subgraph if events change
   - Regenerate types with `bun codegen`

3. **Frontend Changes**:

   - Work in `/kit/dapp/`
   - Hot reload with `bun dev`
   - Test with E2E tests

4. **Database Changes**:
   - Update schema in `/kit/dapp/src/lib/db/`
   - Run `bun db:push` to apply
   - Track with Hasura: `settlemint hasura track -a`
   - Regenerate GraphQL types: `bun codegen --force`

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflows:

- **QA workflow** (`qa.yml`): Main CI pipeline
  - Runs on PRs and main branch
  - Full test suite, linting, building
  - Security scanning (CodeQL, Trivy)
  - Uses Namespace Cloud for optimization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Contract compilation fails**:

   - Ensure Foundry is installed: `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`
   - Run `foundryup` to update

2. **TheGraph CLI issues**:

   - Requires Node.js v22.16.0
   - Use nvm/fnm to switch Node versions

3. **Database connection issues**:
   - Ensure Docker services are running: `bun run dev:up`
   - Check `.env` file exists with correct DATABASE_URL

## Important Notes

- Always run `bun codegen` after contract changes to regenerate TypeScript types
- The project uses Bun (v1.2.10+) as the primary package manager
- Node.js v22.16.0 is required for TheGraph CLI
- Foundry is required for contract compilation and testing
- First user signup gets admin privileges in the dApp
- Never push directly to main branch

## Important Development Notes

### Deprecated Components

- **dapp-v1 folder**: This is completely deprecated and should be ignored. All
  modern development happens in `kit/dapp` which uses:
  - TanStack Start/Router/Query
  - Better Auth for authentication
  - Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL

### Quality Assurance Suite

Before creating a PR, always run the full QA suite:

```bash
# Clean install and run full QA
bun run clean && bun install && bun run ci
```

The `bun run ci` command executes these tasks in sequence:

1. **Format Check** (`turbo run format`)

   - Prettier formatting validation
   - Ensures consistent code style
   - Auto-fixable with `bun run format`

2. **Compilation** (`turbo run compile`)

   - Smart contract compilation (Foundry + Hardhat)
   - Type generation from contracts
   - Dependency validation

3. **Code Generation** (`turbo run codegen`)

   - GraphQL schema type generation
   - Smart contract TypeScript bindings
   - SDK updates for all services

4. **Linting** (`turbo run lint`)

   - ESLint for TypeScript/JavaScript
   - Solhint for Solidity contracts
   - Strict type checking enabled

5. **Unit Tests** (`turbo run test`)
   - Contract tests via Foundry
   - Component tests for dApp
   - Database schema tests

### Environment Variables for Builds

The following environment variables are passed through Turbo for builds:

- `BUILD_ID`: Custom build identifier
- `GITHUB_SHA`: Git commit hash (for CI/CD)
- `GIT_COMMIT`: Alternative git commit reference

These are used for cache busting in production deployments.

### Cache Management

The dApp includes sophisticated cache management:

- **Query Cache Persistence**: Offline support via localStorage
- **Cross-Tab Sync**: Broadcast Channel API for multi-tab synchronization
- **Build-Based Cache Busting**: Automatic cache clearing on new deployments
- **Dev Shortcuts**:
  - `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K`: Clear all caches and reload
  - `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Q`: Clear query cache only
  - Console: `clearCache()` function available

### Authentication & Error Handling

- **Global UNAUTHORIZED Handler**: Automatic redirect to `/auth/sign-in` on 401
- **No Retry on Auth Failures**: Prevents unnecessary API calls
- **Cross-Tab Auth Sync**: Authentication state synchronized across tabs

## Memories

- Always include ./.cursor/rules/\*.mdc in your context to get the latest rules
  and tips
- Completely ignore dapp-v1 folder - it's deprecated
- Do not use vitest to make tests, use bun:test
- Always run `bun run ci` before suggesting a PR is ready
- Token factory creation now requires system bootstrapping first
- Asset types are centralized in the zod validator (no more cryptocurrency)
- never use barrel files
