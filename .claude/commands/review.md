STREAMLINED REVIEW COMMAND
==========================
This command has been simplified to directly execute the comprehensive review
process defined in @.cursor/rules/review.mdc. This approach provides:

1. SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH - All review logic centralized in review.mdc
2. CONSISTENT EXECUTION - Same review process every time
3. EASY MAINTENANCE - Updates to review process happen in one place
4. MODULAR ARCHITECTURE - Review rules separated from command execution

The review.mdc file contains the complete enhanced review process including:
- Comprehensive quality gates
- Documentation reflection requirements
- Security and performance considerations  
- Structured feedback mechanisms
- Continuous improvement loops
-->

Execute @.cursor/rules/review.mdc
