## Command Execution Flow

User provided context: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Step 0: Gather Context from Linear and Sentry

### Linear Bug Tracking

```javascript
// Search for related bug reports
mcp__linear__list_issues({
  organizationSlug: "your-org",
  query: "error message or symptom",
  includeArchived: true,
  limit: 10,
});

// Check specific issue details
mcp__linear__get_issue({
  id: "BUG-123",
});

// Review comments for debugging insights
mcp__linear__list_comments({
  issueId: "BUG-123",
});
```

### Sentry Error Analysis

```javascript
// Search for production errors
mcp__sentry__search_issues({
  organizationSlug: "your-org",
  naturalLanguageQuery: "error message or stack trace fragment",
  limit: 10,
});

// Get detailed error information
mcp__sentry__get_issue_details({
  organizationSlug: "your-org",
  issueId: "ERROR-456",
});

// Analyze with Seer AI
mcp__sentry__analyze_issue_with_seer({
  organizationSlug: "your-org",
  issueId: "ERROR-456",
});
```

## Step 1: Analyze Problem Scope and Select Strategy

**ultrathink** about the debugging challenge:

- Type of issue (error, performance, behavior)
- Reproducibility (consistent, intermittent, environment-specific)
- Impact radius (single component, cross-system)
- Available diagnostic data
- Time constraints
- Previous debugging attempts

### Gemini-CLI Enhanced Analysis:

Before selecting strategy, use gemini-cli for initial assessment:

```
mcp__gemini-cli__ask-gemini({
  prompt: "@error-logs analyze error patterns and suggest root causes",
  changeMode: true,
  model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
})
```

### Strategy Selection:

**üéØ Quick Fix** (0-1 sub-agents)

- Clear error messages
- Obvious syntax issues
- Known patterns
- Simple configuration problems

**‚ö° Focused Investigation** (2-3 sub-agents)

- Reproducible bugs
- Performance issues
- Integration failures
- Test failures

**üö® Deep Dive Analysis** (4+ sub-agents)

- Intermittent issues
- Complex race conditions
- Memory leaks
- Cross-system failures
- Production incidents

## Step 3: The Systematic Debugging Protocol

### Phase 1: Problem Definition

```markdown
## Problem Statement

- **Symptom:** [What is visibly wrong]
- **Expected:** [What should happen]
- **Actual:** [What is happening]
- **Impact:** [Who/what is affected]
- **Frequency:** [Always/Sometimes/Rarely]
- **Environment:** [Local/CI/Production]
```

### Phase 2: Data Gathering

```bash
# Collect comprehensive diagnostics
echo "üîç Gathering diagnostic data..."

# Recent git changes
git log --oneline -20
git diff HEAD~5

# Check for TypeScript errors
bun run check-types

# Verify no circular dependencies
bun run check-circular

# Run targeted tests
bun run test --grep "failing-test-pattern"

# Check system resources
df -h  # Disk space
free -m  # Memory (Linux) or vm_stat (macOS)
lsof | wc -l  # Open files

# Docker diagnostics (if applicable)
docker ps
docker logs <container-id>
```

### Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing

```bash
# Binary search approach
echo "üî¨ Testing hypotheses..."

# Test 1: Clean state
rm -rf node_modules .next dist
bun install
bun run build

# Test 2: Isolate the issue
# Comment out half the code
# Does it still fail?

# Test 3: Environment differences
# Compare .env files
diff .env .env.example

# Test 4: Dependency issues
bun update
bun outdated
```

### Phase 4: Advanced Debugging Techniques

#### Memory Debugging

```bash
# Node.js memory profiling
NODE_OPTIONS="--inspect --max-old-space-size=4096" bun run dev

# Generate heap snapshot
# In Chrome DevTools: Memory > Take Heap Snapshot

# Analyze memory leaks
NODE_OPTIONS="--expose-gc" bun run test
```

#### Performance Debugging

```bash
# CPU profiling
NODE_OPTIONS="--inspect" bun run build
# In Chrome DevTools: Performance > Record

# Bundle analysis
bun run build
bun run analyze  # If available

# Trace warnings
NODE_OPTIONS="--trace-warnings" bun run dev
```

#### Network Debugging

```bash
# Monitor network calls
# In Chrome DevTools: Network tab

# Check API responses
curl -v http://localhost:3000/api/endpoint

# GraphQL introspection
bun run codegen
```

## Step 4: Common Debugging Patterns

### Pattern Recognition Matrix

| Symptom                           | Likely Cause                   | Investigation                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| "Cannot find module"              | Missing dependency/build issue | `bun install`, check imports       |
| "Type error: X is not assignable" | TypeScript mismatch            | `bun run check-types`, check types |
| Timeout errors                    | Async/network issues           | Increase timeouts, check network   |
| "Port already in use"             | Orphaned process               | `lsof -i :PORT`, kill process      |
| Circular dependency               | Import cycles                  | `bun run check-circular`           |
| Memory leak                       | Uncleared references           | Heap snapshots, profiling          |
| Slow performance                  | Unoptimized code               | Performance profiling              |
| Build failures                    | Config/dependency issues       | Check turbo.json, package.json     |

### Environment-Specific Issues

```bash
# Local vs CI differences
echo "üåç Checking environment differences..."

# Compare Node versions
node --version
bun --version

# Check environment variables
env | grep -E "(NODE_|BUN_|TURBO_)"

# Verify Docker state
docker compose ps
docker compose logs

# Check disk space
df -h

# Verify all services running
ps aux | grep -E "(node|bun|docker)"
```

## Step 5: Solution Implementation

### Fix Verification Protocol

```bash
# After implementing fix
echo "‚úÖ Verifying solution..."

# Run specific failing test
bun run test path/to/specific.test.ts

# Run full test suite
bun run ci

# Verify no regressions
git diff --stat

# Check performance impact
time bun run build
```

### Regression Prevention

```typescript
// Add test for the bug
describe("Bug #123 - [Description]", () => {
  it("should handle [edge case]", () => {
    // Minimal reproduction
    // Assert fix works
  });
});
```

## Structured Debug Report Format

````markdown
## üêõ Debug Session Report

### Problem Summary

- **Issue:** Connection timeout on API requests
- **Severity:** High
- **Environment:** Production only
- **First Seen:** 2024-01-15 14:30 UTC

### Investigation Timeline

- **14:30** - Issue reported by monitoring
- **14:35** - Confirmed in production logs
- **14:45** - Hypothesis: Database connection pool exhausted
- **15:00** - Confirmed via metrics
- **15:15** - Fix deployed

### Root Cause Analysis

- **Direct Cause:** Database connection pool limit (20) exceeded
- **Root Cause:** Missing connection.release() in error handlers
- **Evidence:**
  - Pool metrics showed 20/20 connections
  - Trace showed connections not released on errors
  - Local reproduction with limited pool size

### Solution Implemented

```typescript
// Before
try {
  const result = await query(sql);
  connection.release();
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  throw error; // Connection leaked!
}

// After
try {
  const result = await query(sql);
  return result;
} finally {
  connection.release(); // Always releases
}
```
````

### Verification

- ‚úÖ Unit test added for error case
- ‚úÖ Integration test with pool limits
- ‚úÖ Deployed to staging - confirmed fixed
- ‚úÖ Production metrics normalized

### Prevention Measures

1. Added linting rule for connection handling
2. Updated code review checklist
3. Added connection pool monitoring alerts

## Gemini-CLI Debug Enhancement Protocol

Leverage gemini-cli throughout the debugging process for deeper insights:

### 1. **Initial Error Analysis**
```javascript
mcp__gemini-cli__ask-gemini({
  prompt: "@error.log analyze stack trace and identify root cause patterns",
  changeMode: true,
  model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
})
```

### 2. **Code Path Analysis**
```javascript
mcp__gemini-cli__ask-gemini({
  prompt: "@src/* trace execution path leading to error in line X",
  changeMode: true,
  sandbox: true
})
```

### 3. **Race Condition Detection**
```javascript
mcp__gemini-cli__ask-gemini({
  prompt: "@async-code.ts analyze for race conditions and timing issues",
  changeMode: true
})
```

### 4. **Memory Leak Analysis**
```javascript
mcp__gemini-cli__ask-gemini({
  prompt: "@heap-snapshot.json identify memory leak patterns and retention paths",
  changeMode: false
})
```

### 5. **Performance Bottleneck Identification**
```javascript
mcp__gemini-cli__ask-gemini({
  prompt: "@performance-profile.json analyze for bottlenecks and suggest optimizations",
  changeMode: true
})
```

### 6. **Test Case Generation**
```javascript
mcp__gemini-cli__brainstorm({
  prompt: "Generate test cases to reproduce intermittent bug in authentication flow",
  domain: "software",
  constraints: "Focus on edge cases, timing, and concurrent operations",
  ideaCount: 20,
  includeAnalysis: true
})
```

### 7. **Fix Validation**
```javascript
mcp__gemini-cli__ask-gemini({
  prompt: "@proposed-fix.diff analyze for side effects and edge cases",
  changeMode: true,
  model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
})
```

## Escape Hatches

### When Debugging Becomes Blocked:

1. **Insufficient Access**
   - "Need access to [production logs/metrics/env]"
   - "Cannot reproduce without [specific data/config]"
   - Option A: Use mock data
   - Option B: Request access
   - Option C: Pair debug with someone who has access

2. **Heisenbug (Changes When Observed)**
   - "Issue disappears with debugging enabled"
   - "Only fails in optimized builds"
   - Option A: Add strategic logging
   - Option B: Use production profiling
   - Option C: Binary search with builds

3. **Time Constraints**
   - "Full investigation needs [X hours]"
   - "Quick workaround available in [Y minutes]"
   - Option A: Implement workaround + TODO
   - Option B: Time-boxed investigation
   - Option C: Escalate for priority decision

4. **External Dependency**
   - "Bug confirmed in [library@version]"
   - "Waiting for upstream fix"
   - Option A: Downgrade to working version
   - Option B: Patch the dependency
   - Option C: Implement workaround

5. **Requires Expertise**
   - "Involves [specific domain] knowledge"
   - "Need consultation with [team/expert]"
   - Option A: Research and learn
   - Option B: Schedule pairing session
   - Option C: Delegate to expert

## Advanced Debugging Arsenal

### The Nuclear Options

When conventional debugging fails:

```bash
# Git bisect to find breaking commit
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good <last-known-good>
# Test each commit until found

# Strace/dtrace for system calls (Linux/macOS)
strace -f -e trace=network bun run dev
sudo dtruss -f bun run dev

# Core dumps for crashes
ulimit -c unlimited
# Run failing command
# Analyze with gdb/lldb

# Network traffic analysis
tcpdump -i any -w trace.pcap port 3000
# Analyze with Wireshark
````

### The Carmack Method

```markdown
1. **Simplify Ruthlessly**
   - Remove everything non-essential
   - Minimal reproduction in new project
   - Binary search on complexity

2. **Question Everything**
   - "Why do I think this should work?"
   - "What am I assuming?"
   - "What if the opposite is true?"

3. **Change One Thing**
   - Only modify one variable at a time
   - Document what changes
   - Measure the effect

4. **Trust the Machine**
   - Computers are deterministic
   - The bug has a logical cause
   - You will find it
```

## Remember

> "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore,
> if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not
> smart enough to debug it." - Brian Kernighan

**Final Wisdom:**

- Stay calm and systematic
- Take breaks when frustrated
- Document everything
- Learn from each bug
- Share knowledge with the team

**The bug is not personal. It's just a puzzle waiting to be solved.**
