## Command Execution Flow

User provided context: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Step 1: Analyze QA Scope and Select Strategy

**ultrathink** about the testing requirements:
- Codebase size and complexity
- Recent changes and their impact
- Critical paths requiring focus
- Performance requirements
- Security considerations
- Integration points

### Strategy Selection:

**üéØ Quick Validation** (0-1 sub-agents)
- Minor bug fixes
- Documentation changes
- Configuration updates
- Single component changes

**‚ö° Standard QA** (2-4 sub-agents)

## Step 2: Execute Multi-Agent Quality Assurance

**CRITICAL:** All agents must run in parallel using the orchestrated `bun run ci` command. Generate specialized agents based on the QA scope.

### Dynamic Agent Allocation Pattern:

```
Small changes (1-5 files): 2 agents (Test Runner, Code Analyzer)
Medium changes (6-20 files): 4 agents (+ Coverage Analyst, Performance Validator)
Large changes (20+ files): 6+ agents (+ Security Auditor, Integration Specialist)
Critical changes: All agents + domain experts
```

### Core Agent Templates:

```

## Step 3: Pre-Flight Environment Checks

### Environment Verification

```bash
# Ensure clean environment
echo "üîç Checking environment readiness..."

# Verify dependencies
if ! bun install --frozen-lockfile; then
    echo "‚ùå Dependency installation failed"
    exit 1
fi

# Check for required services
services=("database" "redis" "api")
for service in "${services[@]}"; do
    if ! pgrep -f "$service" > /dev/null; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: $service not running"
    fi
done

# Verify test command exists
if ! bun run --filter list | grep -q "ci"; then
    echo "‚ùå 'bun run ci' command not found"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Database State

```bash
# Ensure database is migrated
bun run db:migrate
bun run db:seed:test  # If test data needed
```

## Step 4: Execute Quality Gates

### Primary Execution

```bash
# ALWAYS use the CI command for comprehensive testing
echo "üöÄ Executing comprehensive quality assurance..."
bun run ci
```

This orchestrated command automatically runs:
1. **Static Analysis** (types, lint, format)
2. **Unit Tests** (isolated component testing)
3. **Integration Tests** (component interaction)
4. **E2E Tests** (user workflows, handled)
5. **Performance Tests** (if configured)
6. **Coverage Analysis** (code coverage metrics)
7. **Security Scans** (dependency audits)

### Parallel Quality Checks

For additional validation:

```bash
# Run these in parallel with main CI
bun run audit           # Security audit
bun run build           # Build validation
bun run analyze         # Bundle analysis
```

## Step 5: Results Analysis and Scoring

### Quality Score Calculation

```typescript
function calculateQualityScore(results: QAResults): QualityGrade {
    const weights = {
        tests: 0.30,
        coverage: 0.25,
        codeQuality: 0.20,
        performance: 0.15,
        security: 0.10
    };

    const score =
        (results.tests.passRate * weights.tests) +
        (results.coverage.percentage * weights.coverage) +
        (results.codeQuality.score * weights.codeQuality) +
        (results.performance.score * weights.performance) +
        (results.security.score * weights.security);

    return getGrade(score);
}
```

### Grade Thresholds

- **A** (95-100%): Ship with confidence
- **B** (85-94%): Good, minor improvements possible
- **C** (75-84%): Acceptable, address issues soon
- **D** (65-74%): Risky, significant issues present
- **F** (<65%): Blocked, must fix critical issues

## Step 6: Failure Investigation Protocol

When tests fail, execute targeted investigation:

### Failure Categories

1. **Test Failures**
   ```bash
   # Re-run specific failed test
   bun run test path/to/failed.test.ts --verbose

   # Run with debugging
   NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' bun run test path/to/failed.test.ts
   ```

2. **Type Errors**
   ```bash
   # Get detailed type error information
   bun run typecheck --pretty
   ```

3. **Lint Violations**
   ```bash
   # Auto-fix where possible
   bun run lint --fix

   # Show remaining issues
   bun run lint --format stylish
   ```

4. **Coverage Gaps**
   ```bash
   # Generate detailed coverage report
   bun run test --coverage --coverage-reporter=html
   open coverage/index.html
   ```

## Escape Hatches

### When QA Encounters Issues:

1. **Flaky Tests**
   - "Test [name] failed intermittently (2/5 runs)"
   - "Likely timing/race condition in:"
   - Option A: Add retry mechanism
   - Option B: Increase timeout
   - Option C: Refactor for determinism
   - Ask: "How should I handle flaky tests?"

2. **Environment Differences**

   - "Detected differences:"
   - - Node version mismatch
   - - Missing environment variables
   - - Service availability
   - Option A: Align environments
   - Option B: Mock external dependencies
   - Ask: "Which environment is canonical?"

3. **Performance Regression**
   - "Performance degraded by [X%]"
   - "Main contributors:"
   - - Bundle size increase
   - - Unoptimized queries
   - - Memory leaks
   - Option A: Optimize before proceeding
   - Option B: Accept new baseline
   - Option C: Investigate further
   - Ask: "Is this regression acceptable?"

4. **Coverage Below Threshold**
   - "Coverage at [X%], threshold is [Y%]"
   - "Uncovered areas pose risk in:"
   - - Critical business logic
   - - Error handling paths
   - - New features
   - Option A: Add tests now
   - Option B: Create tech debt ticket
   - Option C: Adjust thresholds
   - Ask: "Block deployment for coverage?"

5. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - "Found [N] vulnerabilities:"
   - - Critical: [list]
   - - High: [list]
   - - Medium: [list]
   - Option A: Patch dependencies
   - Option B: Implement workarounds

## Advanced QA Patterns

### Incremental Testing
For large changes, test incrementally:
```bash
# Test affected modules first
bun run test src/affected-module --watch

# Then run full suite
bun run ci
```

### Parallel Test Execution
Maximize efficiency:
```bash
# Split tests across workers
bun run test --shard=1/4 &
bun run test --shard=2/4 &
bun run test --shard=3/4 &
bun run test --shard=4/4 &
wait
```

### Test Impact Analysis
Run only affected tests:
```bash
# Detect changed files
changed_files=$(git diff --name-only main...)

# Run related tests
bun run test --findRelatedTests $changed_files
```

### Performance Profiling
Deep performance analysis:
```bash
# CPU profiling
bun run test --cpu-prof

# Memory profiling
bun run test --heap-prof

# Generate flame graphs
bun run profile:analyze
```

## Quality Gate Enforcement

Before marking QA as complete:

- [ ] All tests pass (100%)
- [ ] Code coverage meets thresholds
- [ ] No type errors
- [ ] No lint errors (warnings acceptable)
- [ ] Performance within baselines
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Build successful
- [ ] E2E tests pass
- [ ] Quality score ‚â• B grade

**CRITICAL:** Never bypass quality gates. If issues exist, they must be explicitly acknowledged and documented with remediation plans.
