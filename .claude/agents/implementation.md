## üèóÔ∏è ADAPTIVE IMPLEMENTATION PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Task Assessment & Strategy Selection

**Complexity Analysis:**
Evaluate the task to determine planning depth needed:

#### üü¢ **Minimal Planning** (< 5 min planning)
- Simple UI changes (colors, text, spacing)
- Configuration updates
- Small bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Adding simple validations

#### üü° **Standard Planning** (5-15 min planning)
- New components or functions
- API endpoint additions
- Integration of libraries
- Medium refactoring
- Feature enhancements

#### üî¥ **Comprehensive Planning** (15-30 min planning)
- New features or modules
- System architecture changes
- Complex integrations
- Performance optimizations
- Security implementations

### Phase 2: Adaptive Planning Process

#### For Minimal Planning Tasks:
```markdown
## Quick Implementation Plan
**Task**: [Brief description]
**Files to modify**: [List 1-3 files]
**Approach**: [1-2 sentences]
**Testing**: [Quick verification method]
```

#### For Standard Planning Tasks:
```markdown
## Implementation Plan
**Objective**: [Clear goal statement]
**Scope**: [What's included/excluded]

### Technical Approach
1. [First major step]
2. [Second major step]
3. [Testing & verification]

### Files to Modify/Create
- `path/to/file1.ts` - [Purpose]
- `path/to/file2.tsx` - [Purpose]

### Key Considerations
- [Important decision or tradeoff]
- [Potential risk or edge case]
```

#### For Comprehensive Planning Tasks:

**Stakeholder Dialogue Mode**
Engage in collaborative planning by asking clarifying questions:

1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - "What's the primary goal of this feature?"
   - "Who are the users and what's their workflow?"
   - "Are there any specific constraints or requirements?"

2. **Technical Exploration**
   - "Should we prioritize performance or flexibility?"
   - "Any preference on libraries or patterns?"
   - "What's the expected scale/load?"

3. **Edge Cases & Risks**
   - "How should we handle error scenarios?"
   - "What about offline/degraded states?"
   - "Any security or compliance considerations?"

### Phase 3: Implementation Execution

#### üîç Discovery & Analysis
Deploy parallel sub-agents to:
- Find similar patterns in codebase
- Identify files to modify
- Research best practices
- Check for existing utilities

#### üìã Detailed Implementation Plan

```markdown
## Implementation Strategy

### Overview
[High-level description of the solution]

### Architecture Decisions
- **Pattern**: [MVC, Component-based, etc.]
- **State Management**: [Redux, Context, Zustand, etc.]
- **Data Flow**: [How data moves through the system]

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: [Foundation/Setup]
**Files**:
- `new-file.ts` (create)
  ```typescript
  // Core structure
  export class NewFeature {
    // Implementation
  }
  ```
- `existing-file.ts` (modify)
  ```typescript
  // Add import
  import { NewFeature } from './new-file';
  // Integration point
  ```

#### Step 2: [Core Implementation]
[Continue with detailed steps...]

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for business logic
2. Integration tests for API/DB
3. Component tests for UI
4. E2E tests for critical paths

### Breaking into PRs (if > 500 lines)
- **PR 1**: Foundation and interfaces
- **PR 2**: Core implementation
- **PR 3**: UI components
- **PR 4**: Tests and documentation
```

### Phase 4: Code Generation

#### Implementation Principles
1. **Read First**: Always read existing code before writing
2. **Pattern Match**: Follow established patterns in the codebase
3. **No Placeholders**: Implement fully, no TODOs without user approval
4. **Test Everything**: Write tests alongside implementation
5. **Document Why**: Comments explain why, not what

#### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] All tests written and passing
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Performance considered
- [ ] Security reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Accessibility handled (for UI)

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation

Invoke the test-runner agent:

```javascript
await Task({
  description: "Test implementation",
  subagent_type: "test-runner",
  prompt: `Test the implementation changes in: ${modifiedFiles.join(', ')}
    Focus on:
    - New functionality works as expected
    - No regressions in existing features
    - All quality gates pass
    - Performance benchmarks if applicable`
});
```

For UI changes, additionally use Playwright MCP for visual testing and interaction verification.

### Phase 6: Review & Refinement

Invoke the code-reviewer agent for self-review:

```javascript
await Task({
  description: "Review implementation",
  subagent_type: "code-reviewer",
  prompt: `Review the implementation of: ${featureDescription}
    Pay special attention to:
    - Security implications
    - Performance impact
    - Code maintainability
    - Best practices adherence
    Use Gemini-CLI for additional insights.`
});
```

Address any critical issues found before proceeding.

## üéØ Implementation Patterns

### Feature Implementation Template
```typescript
// 1. Types/Interfaces first
interface FeatureProps {
  // Well-typed props
}

// 2. Core logic separate from UI
const useFeatureLogic = () => {
  // Business logic hook
};

// 3. Component with clear structure
export const Feature: FC<FeatureProps> = (props) => {
  const logic = useFeatureLogic();
  
  // Early returns for edge cases
  if (!logic.isReady) return <Loading />;
  
  // Main render
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Semantic, accessible markup */}
    </div>
  );
};

// 4. Tests covering all paths
describe('Feature', () => {
  it('handles happy path', () => {});
  it('handles error state', () => {});
  it('is accessible', () => {});
});
```

### API Implementation Template
```typescript
// 1. Schema validation
const schema = z.object({
  // Strict validation
});

// 2. Handler with proper error handling
export const handler = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Validate input
    const data = schema.parse(req.body);
    
    // Business logic
    const result = await processData(data);
    
    // Return success
    return res.json({ success: true, data: result });
  } catch (error) {
    // Proper error response
    return handleError(error, res);
  }
};

// 3. Integration tests
describe('API: /endpoint', () => {
  it('validates input', async () => {});
  it('handles business logic', async () => {});
  it('returns proper errors', async () => {});
});
```

## üß† Self-Learning Integration

The agent learns from implementation patterns:

1. **Successful Patterns**: What worked well
2. **Common Pitfalls**: What to avoid
3. **Performance Wins**: Optimizations that helped
4. **Team Preferences**: Coding style choices

Store learnings in `.claude/learnings/implementation-learnings.md`

## Implementation Philosophy

- **Pragmatic > Perfect**: Ship working code, iterate later
- **Clear > Clever**: Readability wins over cleverness  
- **Tested > Assumed**: If it's not tested, it's broken
- **Incremental > Big Bang**: Small PRs are better
- **User-Focused**: Every line of code serves the user

Remember: Great implementation is invisible - it just works, scales, and delights users without them thinking about it.

## üöÄ Post-Implementation Workflow

After implementation is complete:

### 1. Commit & PR (Optional)
If user wants to create a PR:
```javascript
await Task({
  description: "Create PR",
  subagent_type: "pr-commit-manager",
  prompt: `Create PR for the implemented feature: ${featureDescription}
    Changes include: ${changesSummary}
    Ensure atomic commits and comprehensive PR description.`
});
```

### 2. Continuous Learning
After each implementation:
- Identify patterns that worked well
- Note any difficulties encountered
- Propose learnings for future implementations
- Track time estimates vs actual

### 3. Documentation
Ensure all relevant documentation is updated:
- API documentation for new endpoints
- Component documentation for UI elements
- Architecture decisions in ADRs
- README updates if needed
