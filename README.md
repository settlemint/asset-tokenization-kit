## Introduction

The SettleMint Asset Tokenization Kit is a full-stack solution designed to
accelerate the development of digital asset platforms. With built-in tools for
smart contract deployment, asset tracking, and seamless blockchain interactions,
the kit simplifies the creation of secure and scalable tokenization solutions.

**Note**: The `dapp-v1` folder is deprecated and no longer used. All development
should focus on the modern stack in `kit/dapp`.

## Documentation & Development Guidelines

This repository includes comprehensive documentation to ensure consistent,
high-quality development:

- **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** - Complete project guide for Claude Code with
  architecture, commands, and development standards
- **[CLAUDE.local.md](./CLAUDE.local.md)** - Organizational rules and modular
  development framework
- **[.cursor/rules/](./cursor/rules/)** - Specialized rule modules for different
  aspects of development (git, QA, review, tools)
- **[.claude/commands/](./claude/commands/)** - Automated workflow commands for
  common development tasks

### Key Features:

- üèóÔ∏è **Complete Architecture Documentation** - Understand the monorepo structure
  and design patterns
- üîß **Essential Command Reference** - All critical development workflows in one
  place
- üìã **Quality Control Checklists** - Comprehensive pre-PR requirements and
  testing standards
- üîÑ **Self-Improving System** - Documentation that evolves based on lessons
  learned
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security Standards** - Enhanced review process with security
  considerations
- üéØ **Modular Rule System** - Organized, maintainable development guidelines

## Local development

### Setting up

```bash
# Install the dependencies
bun install
# Enable remote caching
bun turbo link
# Generate the artifacts
bun run artifacts
# Start the docker compose setup
bun run dev:up # dev:reset will clean up and do up if you need to start fresh
```

### Typical development workflow

If you make changes to any artifacts, you need to generate the artifacts again.

- Smart contracts (in the `kit/contracts` folder)
- Database schema (in the `kit/dapp/src/lib/db/schemas` folder)
- Subgraph (in the `kit/subgraph` folder)

This can be done with the following command:

```bash
bun run artifacts
```

This will generate a new genesis file, initial database script, portal ABIs,
predeployed subgraph hash, etc.

After generating the artifacts, you need to start the docker compose setup
again. This will clean up the existing docker compose setup and start a new one
with the new predeployed contracts and subgraph, a new initial database and a
portal with the new ABIs.

```bash
bun run dev:reset
```

### Quality Assurance

The project uses a comprehensive QA suite to ensure code quality and
functionality. The main command to run before creating a PR is:

```bash
# Run the complete QA suite
bun run ci
```

This command (`bun run ci`) executes the following tasks in order:

1. **Format Check** (`bun run format`)
   - Validates code formatting using Prettier
   - Ensures consistent code style across the project

2. **Compilation** (`bun run compile`)
   - Compiles smart contracts using Foundry and Hardhat
   - Generates TypeScript types from contracts
   - Validates contract syntax and dependencies

3. **Code Generation** (`bun run codegen`)
   - Generates GraphQL types from schemas
   - Creates TypeScript bindings for smart contracts
   - Updates SDK types for Portal, TheGraph, and Hasura

4. **Linting** (`bun run lint`)
   - Runs ESLint on TypeScript/JavaScript code
   - Checks for code quality issues and potential bugs
   - Enforces coding standards and best practices

5. **Testing** (`bun run test`)
   - Runs unit tests for smart contracts (Foundry)
   - Executes component tests for the dApp
   - Validates business logic and edge cases

### Generating the artifacts

This will change the genesis file, initial database and the portal ABIs that are
deployed in docker compose.

```bash
# Update the artifacts
bun run artifacts
# Start the docker compose setup
bun run dev:up
# OR restart the docker compose setup
bun run dev:reset
```

### Running the dApp locally

```bash
# Start the docker compose setup
bun run dev:up
# Start the dApp in development mode
bun run dev
```

### Testing the contracts / subgraph

To test the contracts and subgraph locally using an Anvil node and a subgraph
linked to this node you need to do the following.

#### Setup

```bash
# Start the docker compose setup
bun run dev:up
```

#### Test contracts

Run the following command to deploy the contracts to the local network. This
will run the script at `kit/contracts/scripts/hardhat/main.ts`.

```bash
bunx turbo contracts#publish
```

#### Test subgraph

```bash
bunx turbo subgraph#test:integration
```

### Database schema changes

For database schema changes, you need to generate migrations first. This will
create a new migration file in the `kit/dapp/drizzle` folder. The migrations
will be executed automatically when the dApp starts. Also the Hasura will
automatically track the new tables.

```bash
# Navigate to the dapp directory
cd kit/dapp

# Generate Drizzle migrations from schema changes
bun run db:generate
```
