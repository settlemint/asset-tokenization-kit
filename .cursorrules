## Analysis Process

Before responding to any request, follow these steps:

1. Request Analysis

  - Determine task type (code creation, debugging, architecture, etc.)
  - Identify languages and frameworks involved
  - Note explicit and implicit requirements
  - Define core problem and desired outcome
  - Consider project context and constraints

2. Solution Planning

  - Break down the solution into logical steps
  - Consider modularity and reusability
  - Identify necessary files and dependencies
  - Evaluate alternative approaches
  - Plan for testing and validation

3. Implementation Strategy

  - Choose appropriate design patterns
  - Consider performance implications
  - Plan for error handling and edge cases
  - Ensure accessibility compliance
  - Verify best practices alignment

## Code Style and Structure
### General Principles

- Write concise, readable TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement early returns for better readability
- Structure components logically: exports, subcomponents, helpers, types
- When possible covert relative imports where possible to their @/** version.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.
- Always use curly braces in conditionals.

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Prefix event handlers with "handle" (handleClick, handleSubmit)
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components

### TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const maps instead
- Implement proper type safety and inference
- Use satisfies operator for type validation
- Never, ever, use any!
- Prefer for...of instead of forEach.
- For commander-js commands, do not type the action params, they are automatically inferred.
- For wagmi, use version 2 only! And note that useNetwork and useSwitchNetwork are not available in wagmi v2, use useChainId and useSwitchChain instead.

#### Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.

#### Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces to define contracts.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 instructions.
  - Less than 10 public methods.
  - Less than 10 properties.

#### Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
  - Use readonly for data that doesn't change.
  - Use as const for literals that don't change.

#### Functions

- In this context, what is understood as a function will also apply to a method.
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
  - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
  - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
  - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
  - Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

#### Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
  - Avoid using any.
  - Create necessary types.
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.

#### Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
  - Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res, next for middleware function parameters

### Error Handling and Validation
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
- Model expected errors as return values: Avoid using try/catch for expected errors in Server Actions. Use useActionState to manage these errors and return them to the client.
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors: Implement error boundaries using error.tsx and global-error.tsx files to handle unexpected errors and provide a fallback UI.
- Prefer zod for runtime validation of input and output data.

### Data handling

- Use zod for runtime validation of input and output data.
- Use viem for interacting with blockchain data.
- Do not randomly make new types, all data fetching tools in this project have full type safety and I prefer to stick to these types and if you need parts of it extract them from the existing types.

## NextJS

### Basic Principles

- Use modular architecture
- Encapsulate the API in modules.
  - One module per main domain/route.
  - One controller for its route.
    - And other controllers for secondary routes.
  - A models folder with data types.
    - DTOs validated with class-validator for inputs.
    - Declare simple types for outputs.
  - A services module with business logic and persistence.
    - Entities with MikroORM for data persistence.
    - One service per entity.
- A core module for nest artifacts
  - Global filters for exception handling.
  - Global middlewares for request management.
  - Guards for permission management.
  - Interceptors for request management.
- A shared module for services shared between modules.
  - Utilities
  - Shared business logic

## React 19 and Next.js 15 Best Practices
### Component Architecture

- Favor React Server Components (RSC) where possible
- Minimize 'use client' directives
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Suspense for async operations
- Optimize for performance and Web Vitals

### State Management

- Use useActionState instead of deprecated useFormState
- Leverage enhanced useFormStatus with new properties (data, method, action)
- Implement URL state management with 'nuqs'
- Minimize client-side state

### Async Request APIs

- Always use async versions of runtime APIs

```typescript
const cookieStore = await cookies()
const headersList = await headers()
const { isEnabled } = await draftMode()
```

- Handle async params in layouts/pages

```typescript
const params = await props.params
const searchParams = await props.searchParams
```

### Data Fetching

- Fetch requests are no longer cached by default
- Use cache: 'force-cache' for specific cached requests
- Implement fetchCache = 'default-cache' for layout/page-level caching
- Use appropriate fetching methods (Server Components, React Query)
- When in a client component, use react-query for data fetching

### Route Handlers

- Cached route handler example

```typescript
export const dynamic = 'force-static'

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const params = await request.params
  // Implementation
}
```

### UI Development

#### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS with a mobile-first approach
- Implement Shadcn UI and Radix UI components
- Follow consistent spacing and layout patterns
- Ensure responsive design across breakpoints
- Use CSS variables for theme customization

#### Accessibility

- Implement proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Provide appropriate alt text
- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines
- Test with screen readers

#### Performance

- Optimize images (WebP, sizing, lazy loading)
- Implement code splitting
- Use next/font for font optimization
- Configure staleTimes for client-side router cache
- Monitor Core Web Vitals

### Environment and Security

  - Use wallet client for write operations
  - Configure transport with fallback providers
  - Implement proper error handling for RPC failures
  ```typescript
  const client = createPublicClient({
    chain: mainnet,
    transport: fallback([
      http('https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2'),
      http('https://cloudflare-eth.com'),
    ]),
  })
  ```

- Contract Interactions
  - Use strong typing with generated contract types
  - Implement proper error handling for contract calls
  - Use multicall for batching reads
  - Handle ABI management systematically
  ```typescript
  import { getContract } from 'viem'
  import { erc20Abi } from 'viem/abis'

  const contract = getContract({
    address: '0x...',
    abi: erc20Abi,
    publicClient,
  })
  ```

- Data Handling

  const balance = await publicClient.readContract({
    address: '0x...',
    abi: erc20Abi,
    functionName: 'balanceOf',
    args: ['0x...'],
  })

  const formatted = formatEther(balance)
  ```

- Transaction Management
  - Implement proper transaction lifecycle handling
  - Use waitForTransactionReceipt for confirmations
  - Handle transaction replacements
  - Implement proper gas estimation
  ```typescript
  const hash = await walletClient.writeContract({
    address: '0x...',
    abi: erc20Abi,
    functionName: 'transfer',
    args: ['0x...', parseEther('1.0')],
  })

  const receipt = await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({
    hash,
    confirmations: 2,
  })
  ```

- Error Handling
  - Handle network-specific errors
  - Implement proper user feedback
  - Handle transaction failures gracefully
  - Use custom error types
  ```typescript
  try {
    const result = await contract.read.balanceOf(['0x...'])
  } catch (e) {
    if (e.cause?.code === -32603) {
      // Handle RPC internal error
    } else if (e.cause?.code === 4001) {
      // Handle user rejection
    }
    throw e
  }
  ```

- Testing
  - Use anvil for local testing
  - Implement proper mock providers
  - Test error conditions
  - Validate event emissions
  ```typescript
  import { createTestClient, publicActions } from 'viem'
  import { foundry } from 'viem/chains'

    mode: 'anvil',
  }).extend(publicActions)
  ```

## Testing and Validation

### Code Quality

- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Write maintainable, self-documenting code
- Follow security best practices
- Ensure proper type coverage
- Use ESLint and Prettier

### Testing Strategy

- Plan for unit and integration tests
Implement proper test coverage
Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Validate accessibility compliance
- Use React Testing Library

## Documenting

1. The documentation needs to adhere strictly to the TSDoc specification. TSDoc is a proposal to standardize the doc comments used in TypeScript code, so that different tools can extract content without getting confused by each other's markup.
2. The documentation needs to be written in English.
3. The documentation needs to be clear and concise and written in easily understandable language.
4. Use at only the following tags: `@param`, `@returns` and `@throws` if the function can throw an error.
5. Prefer `@inheritDoc` over repeating yourself.
6. Do not use any tags that are not listed in the TSDoc specification.
7. For zod schemas, only describe what the schema is for. Do not describe the individual properties.

Remember: Prioritize clarity and maintainability while delivering robust, accessible, and performant solutions aligned with the latest React 19, Next.js 15, and Vercel AI SDK features and best practices.

Sidenote: To help evaluating your response, always add a confidence score at the end of your response. If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so. If you do not know the answer, say so instead of guessing.

# Asset Tokenization Starter Kit Development Rules

1. Update database configuration to use Zod for environment variable validation
2. Update signin form to use React Hook Form instead of useState hooks for better form management
3. Update signup form to match signin form structure and styling for consistency
