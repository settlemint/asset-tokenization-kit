name: PR Labels (Reusable)

# This is a reusable workflow for applying labels to pull requests.
# It can be used both within this repository and by external repositories.
#
# Usage in this repository:
# ```yaml
# jobs:
#   label-pr:
#     uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-pr-labels.yml
#     with:
#       runs-on: 'namespace-profile-btp-lite'  # optional, defaults to 'ubuntu-latest'
# ```
#
# Usage in external repositories:
# ```yaml
# jobs:
#   label-pr:
#     uses: settlemint/asset-tokenization-kit/.github/workflows/reusable-pr-labels.yml@main
#     with:
#       runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'  # optional, defaults to 'ubuntu-latest'
# ```
#
# Note: External repositories must have a .github/labeler.yml configuration file
# for the multi-labeler action to work properly.
