For files under kit/e2e/, treat kit/e2e/CLAUDE.md as canonical guidance. • Do
not invent or modify package-level scripts/tasks. • Follow the Best Practices in
that CLAUDE.md. • Prefer small, local changes; avoid cross-package edits unless
clearly documented there. • Each test should be isolated and set up its own
state.
