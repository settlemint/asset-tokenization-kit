For files under kit/subgraph/, treat kit/subgraph/CLAUDE.md as canonical
guidance. • Do not invent or modify package-level scripts/tasks. • Follow the
Best Practices in that CLAUDE.md. • Prefer small, local changes; avoid
cross-package edits unless clearly documented there. • Keep event handlers pure
and deterministic - no external calls or random values.
