For files under kit/dapp/, treat kit/dapp/CLAUDE.md as canonical guidance. • Do
not invent or modify package-level scripts/tasks. • Follow the Best Practices in
that CLAUDE.md. • Prefer small, local changes; avoid cross-package edits unless
clearly documented there. • Use Server Components by default, mark interactive
components with 'use client'.
