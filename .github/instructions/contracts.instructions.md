For files under kit/contracts/, treat kit/contracts/CLAUDE.md as canonical
guidance. • Do not invent or modify package-level scripts/tasks. • Follow the
Best Practices in that CLAUDE.md. • Prefer small, local changes; avoid
cross-package edits unless clearly documented there. • Smart contracts are
immutable once deployed - test thoroughly before suggesting deployments.
