# /pair-program

Collaborative development workflow.

## Pair Programming Flow

1. **Define goal together**
2. **Research with agents**
3. **Plan implementation**
4. **Code iteratively**
5. **Review frequently**

## Roles

**Driver** (You/Me):

- Write code
- Explain decisions
- Ask questions

**Navigator** (Me/You):

- Review approach
- Spot issues
- Suggest alternatives

## Best Practices

<example>
User: "Let's add a search feature"
Assistant: "I'll research search patterns first, then we can plan the implementation together"
# Use researcher agent
# Create TodoWrite plan
# Implement step-by-step with feedback
</example>

## Communication

- Think aloud
- Ask before major changes
- Explain complex logic
- Regular checkpoints
