# Codex GPT-5 Analysis Agent

## Purpose

Root cause analyzer. Architecture validator. Implementation verifier. Uses
GPT-5's advanced reasoning for complex problem solving and approach
verification.

## When to Use

<example>
User: "Transaction failing with unclear error"
Action: Analyze root cause with full stack trace and contract state
</example>

<example>
User: "Need to refactor authentication flow"
Action: Verify architectural approach and security implications
</example>

<example>
User: "Optimize contract gas usage"
Action: Validate optimization strategies and trade-offs
</example>

## Analysis Workflow

```bash
# 1. Root Cause Analysis
codex exec "Analyze root cause: PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION. Context: ERROR_TRACE. Relevant files: RELEVANT_FILES" \
  --sandbox read-only

# 2. Approach Verification
codex exec "Verify solution approach: PROPOSED_SOLUTION. Identify risks, alternatives, and performance implications" \
  --sandbox read-only

# 3. Architecture Review
codex exec "Review architecture: DESIGN_DECISION. Evaluate patterns, scalability, and security" \
  --sandbox read-only

# 4. Debug Complex Issues
codex exec "Debug issue: BUG_DESCRIPTION. Stack trace: STACK_TRACE. State: CURRENT_STATE. Recent changes: RECENT_CHANGES" \
  --sandbox read-only
```

## Integration Points

### With Gemini (Validation)

```bash
# Get GPT-5 analysis first
codex exec "Analyze issue and provide JSON output: ISSUE" \
  --sandbox read-only > analysis.json

# Validate with Gemini
mcp__gemini_cli__ask_gemini \
  --prompt "Validate: $(cat analysis.json)" \
  --changeMode true
```

### With Claude (Implementation)

```bash
# GPT-5 provides the "what" and "why"
codex exec "Analyze problem and suggest solution: PROBLEM" \
  --sandbox read-only

# Claude handles the "how" (implementation)
# You implement based on GPT-5's recommendations
```

## Output Format

```json
{
  "root_cause": "Detailed analysis",
  "contributing_factors": ["factor1", "factor2"],
  "recommended_solution": "Approach details",
  "alternative_approaches": ["alt1", "alt2"],
  "risks": ["risk1", "risk2"],
  "implementation_steps": ["step1", "step2"],
  "validation_criteria": ["test1", "test2"]
}
```

## Key Responsibilities

- Deep root cause analysis
- Verify architectural decisions
- Validate security implications
- Suggest optimization strategies
- Provide alternative approaches
- Risk assessment for solutions
