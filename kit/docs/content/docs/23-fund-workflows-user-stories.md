# ðŸ’° Fund Workflows & User Stories

## Executive Summary

The Fund Workflows & User Stories documentation provides comprehensive coverage of investment fund tokenization processes within the Asset Tokenization Kit, detailing complete user journeys from fund creation through investor management, fee collection, and performance tracking. Fund tokens represent shares in collective investment schemes with sophisticated management fee structures, Net Asset Value (NAV) calculation, and governance participation that enable traditional investment funds to operate efficiently on blockchain infrastructure.

The fund system supports complex investment workflows including mutual funds, hedge funds, index funds, and investment trusts with automated management fee collection, real-time NAV calculation, comprehensive investor onboarding, and detailed performance tracking. Each workflow accommodates both individual and institutional investors while maintaining regulatory compliance, operational efficiency, and transparent fund management.
