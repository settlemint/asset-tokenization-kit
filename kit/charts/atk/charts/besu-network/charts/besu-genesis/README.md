# Besu Genesis

The source of this chart is

As it is not published in any Helm repository, we have to copy it here.

It has been adjusted to work with the SettleMint Asset Tokenization Kit.

## Genesis File Storage

This chart stores genesis files in a PersistentVolumeClaim to handle files of any size, including large genesis files that exceed Kubernetes ConfigMap size limits.

### Universal Storage Approach

This chart automatically adapts to any Kubernetes environment without requiring manual configuration:

- **Genesis Storage**: Stored in PersistentVolumeClaim `besu-genesis-pvc` with ReadWriteOnce access (compatible with all storage classes)
- **Genesis Server**: HTTP server (`besu-genesis-server`) serves the genesis file to multiple nodes
- **Automatic Fallback**: Besu nodes use intelligent retrieval with multiple fallback methods
- **Zero Configuration**: Works with any storage class (local-path, EBS, Azure Disk, etc.) without manual setup

### Storage Configuration

Configure storage settings in values.yaml:

```yaml
storage:
  storageClassName: "fast-ssd"  # Optional: specify storage class
  size: "1Gi"                   # Size for PVC
```

### How It Works

1. **Genesis Creation**: The genesis job creates the genesis file and stores it in the PVC (ReadWriteOnce)
2. **Genesis Server**: A dedicated HTTP server mounts the PVC and serves the genesis file
3. **Smart Retrieval**: Each Besu node uses an init container with intelligent fallback:
   - **Method 1**: HTTP download from genesis server (fastest, works universally)
   - **Method 2**: Direct PVC access via temporary pod (fallback)
   - **Method 3**: Extended retry with HTTP server (for slow environments)
4. **Shared Access**: Multiple Besu nodes can access the same genesis file via the HTTP server

### Automatic Compatibility

The chart automatically works with:
- ‚úÖ **Local development** (local-path, hostPath storage)
- ‚úÖ **Cloud providers** (EBS, Azure Disk, GCE PD)
- ‚úÖ **Network storage** (NFS, Ceph, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Any storage class** that supports ReadWriteOnce

### Integration with Besu Nodes

The besu-node chart automatically includes the necessary init container to retrieve the genesis file using intelligent fallback methods. No additional configuration is required - the genesis file is available at `/shared/genesis.json` in the Besu container.

### Benefits

- üöÄ **Zero Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box with any Kubernetes environment
- üîÑ **Intelligent Fallback**: Multiple retrieval methods ensure reliability
- üì¶ **Universal Compatibility**: Supports all storage classes and providers
- ‚ö° **Optimized Performance**: HTTP delivery is fastest for most scenarios
- üõ°Ô∏è **Robust Error Handling**: Detailed logging and graceful degradation
