/**
 * Identity permissions middleware for blockchain-based access control in tokenization platform.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This middleware implements UI/UX access control, not true data security.
 * Claims are stored on-chain for public verifiability - anyone can query the blockchain
 * or TheGraph directly to access all claims data. This middleware controls what gets
 * displayed in the application interface based on user roles, providing:
 * - Clean, role-appropriate user interfaces without information overload
 * - Workflow separation between identity managers and trusted issuers
 * - Prevention of accidental data exposure through UI bugs or misconfigurations
 * - Fail-fast validation to block unauthorized access to admin interfaces
 *
 * Security Model (Application Interface Control):
 * - IDENTITY_MANAGER_ROLE (blockchain): Full access to all users and claims in UI
 * - Trusted issuer for KYC/AML: Can see all users, limited to their claim topics in UI
 * - All other users: No access to user management interfaces (secure default)
 *
 * Business Rules:
 * - Identity managers need full UI visibility for compliance and user management
 * - KYC/AML issuers need user visibility to perform identity verification workflows
 * - Claim topic filtering provides focused UX without showing irrelevant data
 * - Combined roles: blockchain roles take precedence (identity manager wins)
 *
 * Architecture Notes:
 * - Uses fail-fast permission checks before expensive database/TheGraph operations
 * - Fetches all available data from public sources (blockchain/TheGraph) for performance
 * - Applies role-based filtering only at the presentation layer for UI clarity
 * - Separates boolean flags (canSeeAllUsers, canSeeAllClaims) from topic arrays
 *   to ensure explicit security boundaries and prevent logic errors

/**
 * Identity permissions computed for a user based on blockchain roles and trusted issuer status.

 * This interface uses explicit read/write permissions with structured access control

 * data access, and distinguishes between read and write operations.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Identity manager - full access
 * const identityManagerPerms: IdentityPermissions = {
 *   claims: {
 *     read: ["*"], // Can read all claim topics
 *     write: ["kyc", "aml"] // Can write specific claim topics they're trusted issuer for
 *   },
 *   userData: {
 *     read: true, // Can read user profile data
 *     write: true // Can modify user profile data
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * // Claim issuer - limited access
 * const claimIssuerPerms: IdentityPermissions = {
 *   claims: {
 *     read: ["kyc"], // Can only read KYC claims
 *     write: ["kyc"] // Can only write KYC claims
 *   },
 *   userData: {
 *     read: true, // Can read user data (needed for identity verification)
 *     write: false // Cannot modify user profile data
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * // Regular user - no access
 * const regularUserPerms: IdentityPermissions = {
 *   claims: {
 *     read: [], // Cannot read any claims
 *     write: [] // Cannot write any claims
 *   },
 *   userData: {
 *     read: false, // Cannot read user data
 *     write: false // Cannot write user data
 *   }

/**
 * ORPC middleware that enforces identity-based access control with fail-fast validation.
 *
 * This middleware implements upfront permission validation following the same pattern
 * as blockchainPermissionsMiddleware. It computes identity permissions and validates
 * access before route execution, preventing unauthorized access attempts early in the
 * request pipeline. The middleware extends the context with computed permissions for
 * use by route handlers.
 *
 * Middleware Design:
 * - Fail-fast: Validates access before route execution, not during data processing
 * - Context extension: Adds identityPermissions to context for route handlers to use
 * - Target-aware: Uses configurable function to extract target user from request input
 * - Integration: Expects userTrustedIssuerTopics to be set by upstream trustedIssuerMiddleware
 *
 * Security Features:
 * - Authentication required: Rejects unauthenticated requests immediately
 * - System context validation: Ensures proper system initialization
 * - Permission computation: Combines blockchain roles with trusted issuer status
 * - Access validation: Validates target user access before proceeding
 *
 * @param config.getTargetUserId - Function to extract target user ID from request input
 * @returns Configured middleware function that validates identity permissions
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // User list endpoint - no specific target user
 * const usersRouter = baseRouter.use(
 *   identityPermissionsMiddleware({
 *     getTargetUserId: () => undefined, // List operation
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // Individual user endpoint - extract from input
 * const userRouter = baseRouter.use(
 *   identityPermissionsMiddleware({
 *     getTargetUserId: ({ input }) => input.userId,
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // Route handler can access computed permissions
 * .query("getUser", {
