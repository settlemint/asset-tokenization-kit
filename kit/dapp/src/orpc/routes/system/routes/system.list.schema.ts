/**

 * Wraps the array of systems in a response object to match TheGraph's

 * Auto-pagination capabilities:
 * - Handles unlimited system queries (no limit specified)
 * - Automatically batches requests exceeding 1000 systems
 * - Merges multiple batch responses seamlessly
 * - Maintains sort order across paginated results
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Standard query (â‰¤1000 systems)
 * const response = SystemsResponseSchema.parse({
 *   systems: [{ id: "0x123..." }, { id: "0x456..." }]
 * });
 *
 * // Auto-paginated unlimited query
 * const allSystems = await client.systems.list.query({
 *   // No limit = get all systems via auto-pagination
 * });
 *
 * // Large bounded query
 * const manySystems = await client.systems.list.query({
 *   limit: 5000 // Automatically batched into 5 requests
 * });
 * ```
