/**
 * Identity Contract Creation Handler
 *
 * @fileoverview
 * Implements secure identity contract deployment for users in the Asset Tokenization Kit.
 * Identity contracts provide on-chain identity verification and management capabilities
 * that integrate with the compliance and access control systems.
 *
 * @remarks
 * IDENTITY ARCHITECTURE:
 * - Each user can have at most one identity contract per system
 * - Identity contracts are deployed via factory pattern for consistency
 * - Contracts inherit from ERC-735 for claim management
 * - Integration with compliance modules for KYC/AML verification
 *
 * SECURITY BOUNDARIES:
 * - Identity creation requires wallet verification
 * - One identity per wallet address prevents identity farming
 * - Management keys enable secure identity administration
 * - Wallet address becomes primary identity controller
 *
 * DEPLOYMENT PATTERN:
 * - Factory deployment ensures consistent identity contract implementation
 * - Empty management keys array delegates control to wallet address
 * - Initialization sets wallet as primary controller and identity owner
 * - Post-deployment: Identity becomes available for compliance verification
 *
 * PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
 * - Identity deployment: ~150k gas for contract creation
 * - Verification overhead: ~200ms for wallet verification
 * - Conflict detection: O(1) lookup via account read operation
 * - Integration time: ~2-3 seconds for indexing and availability
 *
 * @see {@link readAccount} Account data retrieval for conflict detection
 * @see {@link IATKIdentityFactory} Smart contract factory for identity deployment

/**
 * GraphQL mutation for deploying a new identity contract.
 *
 * @remarks
 * FACTORY DEPLOYMENT: Uses IATKIdentityFactory to create ERC-735 compliant
 * identity contracts with standardized initialization. The factory pattern ensures:
 * - Consistent identity contract implementation across all users
 * - Proper integration with system access control and compliance
 * - Upgradeable identity logic through factory contract upgrades
 *
 * INITIALIZATION PARAMETERS:
 * - _managementKeys: Empty array delegates control to wallet address
 * - _wallet: Primary controller address for the identity contract
 *
 * SECURITY PATTERN: Wallet verification required before identity deployment
 * to prevent unauthorized identity creation and potential identity theft.
 *
 * @param address - Identity factory contract address from system context
 * @param from - User's wallet address that will own the identity contract
 * @param challengeId - Portal verification challenge ID (auto-injected)
 * @param challengeResponse - MFA challenge response (auto-injected)
 * @returns Object containing transaction hash for monitoring deployment

/**
 * ORPC handler for identity contract creation with conflict prevention.
 *
 * @remarks
 * CONFLICT PREVENTION: Checks for existing identity before deployment to prevent
 * duplicate identity contracts and wasted gas. Each wallet can only have one
 * identity contract per system for security and compliance clarity.
 *
 * VERIFICATION INTEGRATION: Uses Portal middleware for wallet verification
 * ensuring only the legitimate wallet owner can create their identity contract.
 *
 * ERROR HANDLING: Graceful handling of account lookup failures with fallback
 * behavior. If account data is unavailable, proceeds with deployment as the
 * smart contract will enforce uniqueness constraints.
 *
 * @param input - Identity creation parameters including wallet verification
 * @param context - ORPC context with authenticated user and system contracts
 * @param errors - Standardized error constructors for consistent error handling
 * @returns Updated account data including the newly created identity contract
 * @throws INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR When identity factory is not available
 * @throws CONFLICT When user already has an identity contract
