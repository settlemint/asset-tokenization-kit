/**
 * Fixed yield schedule withdraw route handler.
 *
 * Withdraws the denomination asset from an existing fixed yield schedule contract.
 * This endpoint handles withdrawing funds from the yield schedule to a specified
 * recipient address.
 *
 * The operation executes a single transaction to withdraw the specified amount
 * of denomination asset from the fixed yield schedule contract to the recipient.
 *
 * Authentication: Required (uses authenticated router)
 * Permissions: Requires system access and appropriate addon permissions
 * Method: POST /fixed-yield-schedule/withdraw
 *
 * @param input - Request parameters containing contract address, amount, and recipient
 * @param context - Request context with Portal client and authenticated user
 * @returns Promise<{transactionHash: string}> - The transaction hash of the withdraw operation
 * @throws UNAUTHORIZED - If user is not authenticated
 * @throws NOT_FOUND - If system context is missing
 * @throws INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR - If withdraw transaction fails
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Withdraw denomination asset from a fixed yield schedule
 * const result = await orpc.fixedYieldSchedule.withdraw.mutate({
 *   contract: "0xabc123...", // Fixed yield schedule contract address
 *   amount: "1000000", // Amount to withdraw
 *   to: "0xdef456...", // Recipient address
 *   walletVerification: {
 *     secretVerificationCode: "123456",
 *     verificationType: "PINCODE"
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * console.log(result.transactionHash); // "0x123abc..."
 * ```
