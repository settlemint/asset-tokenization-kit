/**
 * Token events listing route handler.
 *
 * Retrieves a list of all events for a specific token contract.
 * This endpoint provides a comprehensive audit trail of all actions
 * performed on the token, useful for compliance reporting, activity
 * monitoring, and transaction history views.
 *
 * Authentication: Required (uses token router)
 * Permissions: Requires "read" permission on the specific token
 * Method: GET /token/{tokenAddress}/events
 *
 * @param context - Request context with TheGraph client and token from middleware
 * @returns Promise<EventsResponse> - Object containing array of event objects
 * @throws UNAUTHORIZED - If user is not authenticated
 * @throws FORBIDDEN - If user lacks required read permissions on the token
 * @throws INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR - If TheGraph query fails
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Get all events for a specific token
 * const response = await orpc.token.events.query({
 *   tokenAddress: '0x1234567890abcdef...'
 * });
 *
 * // Access the events
 * response.events.forEach(event => {
 *   console.log(`Event: ${event.eventName} at block ${event.blockNumber}`);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link EventSchema} for the response structure
