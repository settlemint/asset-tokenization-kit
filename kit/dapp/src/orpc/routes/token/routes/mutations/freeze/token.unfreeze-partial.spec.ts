/**
 * Unfreeze Partial Tokens Test Suite
 *
 * WHY: Validates partial token unfreezing functionality essential for regulatory compliance
 * recovery and precision asset management in tokenization platforms.
 *
 * CRITICAL BUSINESS CONTEXT:
 * - Regulatory authorities need ability to selectively restore frozen holdings
 * - Investigation resolution requires precise unfreezing of cleared amounts
 * - Legal settlements may demand partial release of disputed assets
 * - Compliance remediation requires granular control over asset restoration
 *
 * TRADEOFF: Partial unfreezing requires complex accounting but enables surgical
 * compliance operations without disrupting unrelated frozen amounts.
 *
 * SECURITY: Tests verify role-based access controls and proper balance validation
 * to prevent unauthorized asset restoration or accounting manipulation.
