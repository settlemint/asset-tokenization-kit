 *
 * Deletes a setting from the database by its key.
 * This operation is permanent and cannot be undone.
 *
 * Authentication: Required (uses authenticated router)
 * Permissions: Requires "delete" permission - available to admin role only
 * Method: DELETE /settings/:key
 * @param input - Delete parameters containing the setting key
 * @param context - Request context with database connection and authenticated user
 * @returns Promise<{ success: boolean }> - Success status of the deletion
 * @throws UNAUTHORIZED - If user is not authenticated
 * @throws FORBIDDEN - If user lacks required delete permissions
 * @throws NOT_FOUND - If the setting key does not exist
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Client usage:
 * const result = await orpc.settings.delete.mutate({
 *   key: 'systemAddress'
 * });
 * console.log(result.success); // true
 * ```
