/**
 * Account Management Contract
 *
 * This contract defines the type-safe interfaces for account-related operations.
 * It provides endpoints for creating and reading account information, particularly
 * focusing on wallet creation and identity claims management.
 *
 * All endpoints in this contract require authentication, ensuring that account
 * data is properly protected and only accessible to authorized users.
 *
 * @see {@link @/orpc/procedures/auth.contract} - Base authenticated contract
 * @see {@link ./account.router} - Implementation router

 * Create a wallet account for the authenticated user.
 *
 * This endpoint creates a new wallet for the current authenticated user
 * using the SettleMint HD wallet infrastructure. Each user can only have
 * one wallet address, and attempting to create a second wallet will result
 * in a conflict error.
 *
 * @auth Required - User must be authenticated
 * @method POST
 * @endpoint /account/create
 *
 * @input AccountCreateSchema - User ID for wallet creation
 * @returns string - The created wallet address
 *
 * @throws CONFLICT - If user already has a wallet address
 * @throws PORTAL_ERROR - If wallet creation fails in the portal service
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create wallet for current user
 * const walletAddress = await client.account.create({
 *   userId: currentUser.id
 * });
 * console.log(`Wallet created: ${walletAddress}`);
 * ```

 * Read account information including identity claims.

 *
 * @auth Required - User must be authenticated
 * @method GET
 * @endpoint /account/read
 *
 * @input AccountReadSchema - Wallet address to query
 * @returns AccountSchema - Account information including identity claims

 * ```typescript
 * // Read account information
 * const account = await client.account.read({
 *   walletAddress: "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
