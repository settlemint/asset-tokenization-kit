 * Transaction router module.

 * in the main ORPC router.
 *
 * Current routes:
 * - track: GET /transactions/track - Real-time transaction status tracking via SSE
 *
 * The router is designed to be extended with additional transaction management
 * endpoints such as transaction history, gas estimation, and transaction simulation.
