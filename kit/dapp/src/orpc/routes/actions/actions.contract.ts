/**
 * Actions Management Contract
 *
 * This contract defines the type-safe interfaces for actions-related operations.
 * Actions represent time-bound, executable tasks that users can perform on assets.
 * The system supports various action types including XvP settlement approvals/executions
 * and bond maturity operations.
 *
 * Actions have statuses (PENDING, ACTIVE, EXECUTED, EXPIRED) and can be filtered
 * by action status, target addresses, and required roles. All actions returned
 * are scoped to the authenticated user's permissions.
 *
 * Note: Action execution is handled by resource-specific routes (e.g., tokens.mature,
 * xvp.approve, xvp.execute) rather than a generic actions.execute endpoint.
 *
 * @see {@link @/orpc/procedures/base.contract} - Base contract
 * @see {@link ./actions.router} - Implementation router

/**
 * List actions for the authenticated user.
 *
 * This endpoint retrieves actions from TheGraph that are available to the
 * authenticated user. Actions are automatically filtered to only include
 * those where the user is listed as an executor. Additional filtering is
 * available by action status, target addresses, and required roles.
 *
 * @auth Required - User must be authenticated
 * @function GET
 * @endpoint /actions/list
 * @input ActionsListSchema - Filtering and pagination parameters
 * @returns ActionsListResponseSchema - Paginated list of user's actions
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // List pending actions for current user
 * const actions = await client.actions.list({
 *   status: "PENDING",
 *   first: 20,
 *   skip: 0
 * });
 *
 * actions.data.forEach(action => {
 *   console.log(`Action: ${action.name}, Status: ${action.status}`);
 *   console.log(`Active at: ${new Date(Number(action.activeAt) * 1000)}`);
 * });
