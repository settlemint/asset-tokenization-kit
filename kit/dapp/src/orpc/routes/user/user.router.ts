/**
 * User router module.
 *
 * Aggregates all user-related route handlers into a single exportable object.
 * This module serves as the entry point for the lazy-loaded user namespace
 * in the main ORPC router.
 *
 * Current routes:
 * - me: GET /user/me - Retrieve current authenticated user information
 * - search: GET /user/search - Search users by name or wallet address
 * - list: GET /user/list - List users with pagination
 * - read: GET /user/read - Get specific user by ID or wallet address
 * - stats: GET /user/stats - User statistics and metrics
 * - kyc: KYC profile management routes (nested namespace)
 * - claims: Claims management routes (nested namespace)
 * - actions: GET /user/actions - User's accessible actions (alias for /actions/list)
 *
 * The router is designed to be extended with additional user management
 * endpoints such as profile updates, preference management, and session control.
 * @see {@link ./user.contract} - Type-safe contract definitions
 * @see {@link ./routes/user.me} - Current user endpoint implementation
 * @see {@link ./routes/user.stats} - User statistics endpoint implementation
 * @see {@link ./kyc/kyc.router} - KYC profile management routes
