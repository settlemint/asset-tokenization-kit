 * during server-side rendering (SSR) and API route execution. By attaching
 * the headers function to globalThis, we create a bridge between Next.js's
 * header context and the ORPC client's header injection mechanism.
 *
 * The headers are used for:
 * - Authentication token forwarding from incoming requests
 * - CSRF token validation
 * - Request context preservation across internal API calls
 * - Maintaining user session state during SSR
 *
 * @see {@link kit/dapp/src/lib/orpc/orpc.ts} - Client configuration that consumes these headers
