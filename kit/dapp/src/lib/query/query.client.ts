/**
 * Creates and configures a new QueryClient instance with persistence support.

 * This function creates a QueryClient with localStorage persistence, enabling

 *
 * Features:
 * - Persistent cache across browser sessions
 * - Throttled writes to prevent performance issues
 * - Only persists successful queries to avoid storing error states
 * - Graceful fallback if localStorage is unavailable
 * - Automatic cache expiration based on configured max age
 *
 * @returns A configured QueryClient instance with localStorage persistence
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Basic usage in app setup
 * const queryClient = makeQueryClient();
 *
 * // Use in your app root
 * <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
 *   <App />
 * </QueryClientProvider>
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // In a Next.js app with SSR
 * function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
 *   const [queryClient] = useState(() => makeQueryClient());
 *
 *   return (
 *     <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
