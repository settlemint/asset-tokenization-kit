# Writing

Based on the following:

- @kit/dapp/content/AGENTS.md
- @kit/dapp/content/README-docs.md
- @kit/dapp/content/TEMPLATE-MAPPING.md

Write out the content for the following section:

- @kit/dapp/content/docs/architecture/quality-performance

Guidelines:

- Ensure your content is in line with the already written sections (or adjust
  them where needed)
- Verify that you are not hallucinating features, verify with packages in @kit
- A higher level background story can be found in
  https://github.com/settlemint/book-of-dalp (investigate via octocode mcp)

# Reviewing

Review the folowing section:

- @kit/dapp/content/docs/architecture/smart-contracts

Verify that:

- all content from the readme's in @kit/contracts/contracts present
- does it adhere to the writing style described in @kit/dapp/content/AGENTS.md
- based on the smart contracts (.sol) are there any factual errors?
- suggest a series of improvements to these pages
- do these pages follow the optimal template from
  https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/template
- are there any content gaps or pages that are missing and can be beneficial for
  the target reader profile?
- is all content present targetting the right audience? If not, adjust the
  content to the right audience and move information you would be deleting to
  the right section.

Do not actually execute the changes, just review the content and suggest a clear
and detailed plan for improvements.

# TODO's

- When we are referencing code, make sure we have direct links to Github in
  https://github.com/settlemint/asset-tokenization-kit
- the rendinging mermaid placeholder is very in your face, make it hidden while
  rendering
- i feel the pages are all very long, split them up into multiple pages. If
  needed, you can go up to 4 levels deep
