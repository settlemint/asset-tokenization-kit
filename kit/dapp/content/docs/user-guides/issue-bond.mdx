Bond tokens represent fixed-term debt instruments with maturity dates, yield
distributions, and redemption capabilities. This guide walks you through
deploying a compliant bond token from configuration through lifecycle
management.

**Who should read this:** Corporate treasurers, investment bankers, debt capital
markets teams, and financial operations personnel issuing tokenized bonds.

**Time required:** 15-20 minutes for bond deployment; additional time for yield
configuration.

**Prerequisites:**

- Completed [Getting started](/docs/user-guides/getting-started) onboarding
- Bond system factory deployed during onboarding
- Denomination asset (collateral token) deployed or address available
- Bond terms defined (principal, coupon rate, maturity, currency)

## Step 1: Navigate to bond creation

From the main dashboard:

1. Click **Asset Management** in the left sidebar
2. Select **Bonds** from the asset type list
3. Click **Create New Bond Token** button

![Bond creation navigation](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Asset Management section showing Bonds category with existing bonds list and
Create New Bond Token button_

## Step 2: Configure bond parameters

### Basic token information

Enter standard token details:

- **Token name** - Full legal name of the bond offering (e.g., "TechCorp 2027
  Senior Secured Notes")
- **Token symbol** - Trading symbol (e.g., "TECH27")
- **Decimals** - Token divisibility (18 for fractional bonds, 0 for whole-unit
  bonds)
- **Initial supply** - Number of tokens to mint at deployment (or 0 to mint
  later)

![Bond basic information](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Bond
configuration form showing name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply input
fields with validation_

**Naming guidance:** Use a descriptive name that includes issuer, maturity year,
and security type for clear identification.

### Bond-specific parameters

Configure debt instrument properties:

**Maturity date**

Set the timestamp when the bond matures and becomes redeemable:

1. Click the date picker field
2. Select maturity date (must be future date)
3. The platform converts to Unix timestamp automatically

Typical corporate bonds have 1-10 year maturities.

**Face value**

Enter the redemption value per token at maturity:

- Specified in denomination asset units
- Typically set to 1000 (representing $1,000 face value per bond)
- Determines redemption amount: tokens × face value = redemption proceeds

**Denomination asset**

Specify the underlying collateral token:

- Enter the ERC20 contract address for the collateral token
- Common choices: USDC, USDT, or platform stablecoin
- Must be deployed ERC20 contract with decimals() function
- Validates address format and checks contract exists

![Bond-specific parameters](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Bond parameters showing maturity date picker, face value input, and denomination
asset address field with validation_

**Example configuration:**

- Face value: 1000
- Denomination asset: 0x...USDC (USDC stablecoin)
- Result: Each bond token redeems for 1,000 USDC at maturity

## Step 3: Configure yield distribution

Bonds support automated interest/coupon payments through the yield module.

### Yield schedule setup

Define payment schedule:

1. **Enable yield** - Toggle yield distribution on
2. **Payment frequency** - Select from:
   - Quarterly (every 3 months)
   - Semi-annual (every 6 months)
   - Annual (every 12 months)
3. **First payment date** - Set initial distribution date
4. **Yield rate** - Annual percentage rate (entered as basis points)

![Yield schedule configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Yield configuration showing payment frequency dropdown, first
payment date picker, and yield rate input with basis points calculator_

**Yield rate examples:**

- 5% annual = 500 basis points
- 7.5% annual = 750 basis points
- 10% annual = 1000 basis points

### Payment mechanism

The yield module calculates distributions based on:

- **Yield basis** - Face value per token
- **Yield token** - Denomination asset (USDC, USDT, etc.)
- **Holder proportions** - Automatic pro-rata calculation

When a payment date arrives, the platform:

1. Snapshots current token holders
2. Calculates yield owed: (tokens held × face value × rate × time elapsed)
3. Transfers yield tokens from issuer's designated yield wallet
4. Distributes proportionally to all holders

**Funding requirement:** Ensure your designated yield wallet holds sufficient
denomination assets before each payment date.

## Step 4: Set compliance rules

Bond tokens enforce transfer restrictions through compliance modules.

### Regulatory framework selection

Choose applicable regulatory framework:

- **Regulation D** - US private placement (accredited investors only)
- **Regulation S** - Offshore offering (non-US investors)
- **Regulation A** - US public offering (broader investor base)
- **Custom** - Define custom compliance requirements

The platform pre-configures compliance modules for selected framework.

![Compliance framework selection](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Compliance framework cards showing Reg D, Reg S, Reg A, and Custom
options with descriptions_

### Configure compliance modules

For selected framework, configure modules:

**Country restrictions**

Limit bond purchases by jurisdiction:

1. Enable **Country Allow List** module
2. Select permitted countries from list
3. Or enable **Country Block List** and select restricted countries

Regulation D typically restricts to US only; Regulation S excludes US.

**Investor eligibility**

Set OnchainID claim requirements:

- **Accredited investor** claim (required for Reg D)
- **KYC/AML verification** level (typically Level 2 or higher)
- **Qualified purchaser** status (for certain offerings)

Only addresses with all required claims can hold bonds.

**Transfer restrictions**

Configure additional limits:

- **Time Lock** - Enforce holding period (e.g., 12-month lock-up)
- **Transfer Limit** - Cap maximum transfer size
- **Supply Limit** - Set maximum bond issuance amount

![Compliance module configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)

Verification, and Time Lock modules with configuration panels_

## Step 5: Assign operational roles

Grant permissions for bond management:

### Role assignments

Assign addresses to operational roles:

**GOVERNANCE_ROLE**

Manages compliance and bond lifecycle:

- Set yield schedules
- Add/remove compliance modules
- Trigger bond maturation
- Configure identity requirements

Typically assigned to: Legal/compliance team wallet

**SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE**

Controls token supply:

- Mint new bonds (primary issuance)
- Burn bonds (cancellation)
- Batch mint operations

Typically assigned to: Treasury operations wallet

**CUSTODIAN_ROLE**

Handles recovery and freezing:

- Freeze compromised accounts
- Execute forced transfers
- Recover lost tokens

Typically assigned to: Custodian service wallet

**EMERGENCY_ROLE**

Emergency interventions:

- Pause all transfers
- Unpause after incident resolution

Typically assigned to: Security operations wallet

![Role assignment interface](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Role assignment form showing four roles with address inputs, descriptions, and
current assignments_

**Best practice:** Assign different addresses to different roles for separation
of duties. Use multisig wallets for critical roles.

## Step 6: Review and deploy

### Pre-deployment checklist

Review configuration summary:

- [ ] Token name and symbol correct
- [ ] Maturity date set correctly
- [ ] Face value matches term sheet
- [ ] Denomination asset address validated
- [ ] Yield schedule configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Compliance modules match regulatory framework
- [ ] All operational roles assigned to correct addresses
- [ ] Initial supply amount confirmed (or 0 if minting later)

![Deployment summary review](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:

with edit buttons_

### Deploy bond contract

Execute deployment:

1. Click **Deploy Bond Token**
2. Review transaction details in the confirmation modal
3. Enter your PIN or OTP for authentication
4. Confirm transaction

The platform:

1. Deploys bond proxy contract (15-20 seconds)
2. Initializes with your parameters (10 seconds)
3. Assigns roles to specified addresses (5 seconds per role)
4. Registers with identity registry (10 seconds)

Total deployment time: 60-90 seconds

![Deployment progress](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:

indicators (pending/in progress/complete)_

## Step 7: Post-issuance actions

After successful deployment:

### Verify deployment

1. Note the contract address displayed
2. Click **View Bond Token** to navigate to token details page
3. Verify configuration on overview tab:
   - Token information matches parameters
   - Maturity date correct
   - Denomination asset linked
   - Roles assigned correctly

![Bond details overview](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Bond
token details page showing key information, maturity countdown, yield schedule,
and compliance status_

### Mint initial allocation (if needed)

If you deployed with zero initial supply:

1. Navigate to **Actions** tab
2. Click **Mint Bonds**
3. Enter primary investor addresses and amounts
4. Click **Execute Batch Mint**

The platform validates each recipient's OnchainID and compliance status before
minting.

**Compliance check:** Minting fails if recipient lacks required claims. Verify
investor OnchainIDs before attempting mint.

### Fund yield wallet

For bonds with yield distributions:

1. Note the yield wallet address shown on the **Yield** tab
2. Transfer sufficient denomination assets to yield wallet
3. Calculation: (total supply × face value × yield rate × periods) + buffer
4. Verify balance shows adequate funding for upcoming payments

**Funding timeline:** Fund yield wallet at least 24 hours before first payment
date.

### Distribute offering documents

Link legal documentation to token:

1. Navigate to **Documents** tab
2. Click **Upload Offering Document**
3. Select PDF file (offering memorandum, term sheet, etc.)
4. The platform generates cryptographic hash and stores on-chain
5. Document hash displayed for verification

Investors can verify document authenticity by comparing hashes.

## Step 8: Manage bond lifecycle

### Monitor yield distributions

Track automated coupon payments:

1. Navigate to **Yield** tab on bond details page
2. Review upcoming payment schedule
3. Monitor past distributions:
   - Payment date
   - Amount distributed
   - Recipients count
   - Transaction hash

![Yield distribution history](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Yield tab showing upcoming payments schedule and historical distributions table
with dates, amounts, and status_

### Process maturity

When bond reaches maturity date:

1. Navigate to **Actions** tab
2. Click **Mature Bond** (available only after maturity date)
3. Review maturation details:
   - Total redemption amount required
   - Current denomination asset balance
4. Ensure redemption wallet holds sufficient assets
5. Click **Execute Maturation**

Maturation enables token holders to redeem their bonds for denomination assets.

### Handle redemptions

After maturation, investors can redeem:

**Investor action:**

1. Investor navigates to their bond holdings
2. Clicks **Redeem Bonds**
3. Enters amount to redeem
4. Receives denomination assets proportionally

**Issuer monitoring:**

- Track redemptions on **Holders** tab
- Monitor denomination asset reserve balance
- Review redemption events on **Events** tab

![Redemption tracking](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Bond
events tab showing redemption transactions with holder addresses, amounts
redeemed, and timestamps_

## Common workflows

### Increase bond supply

To issue additional bonds after initial deployment:

1. Prepare new investor list with OnchainIDs verified
2. Navigate to **Actions** &gt; **Mint Bonds**
3. Enter recipient addresses and amounts
4. Execute batch mint

**Compliance note:** All recipients must meet eligibility requirements;
non-compliant addresses cause transaction revert.

### Modify yield schedule

To change payment frequency or rate:

1. Navigate to **Yield** tab
2. Click **Update Schedule**
3. Modify parameters (new payments only; past payments immutable)
4. Requires GOVERNANCE_ROLE permission

### Handle compromised investor account

If investor reports compromised wallet:

1. Navigate to **Participants** &gt; **Entities**
2. Search for investor address
3. Click **Actions** &gt; **Freeze Account**
4. Initiate recovery process to new wallet:
   - Navigate to **Actions** &gt; **Recover Tokens**
   - Enter frozen address and new recovery address
   - Execute forced transfer
5. Unfreeze new address

Requires CUSTODIAN_ROLE permission.

## Best practices

**Before deployment:**

- Coordinate with legal team to ensure compliance template matches regulatory
  filing
- Verify denomination asset is widely held stablecoin for easier distribution
- Test yield calculations with sample investor list
- Prepare investor onboarding process before primary issuance

**During lifecycle:**

- Fund yield wallet 48 hours before payment dates
- Monitor compliance module parameters for regulatory changes
- Maintain audit trail documentation for all corporate actions
- Review holder list monthly for compliance status changes

**At maturity:**

- Notify investors 30 days before maturity date
- Ensure redemption reserve fully funded before maturation
- Monitor redemption rate post-maturity
- Handle unredeemed bonds per offering terms (typically escheatment)

## Troubleshooting

**Deployment fails with "Invalid denomination asset"**

- Verify address is valid ERC20 contract
- Check denomination asset has decimals() function
- Ensure denomination asset is not a proxy without proper interface

**Yield distribution reverts**

- Check yield wallet has sufficient denomination asset balance
- Verify yield token address matches denomination asset
- Ensure all holders have verified OnchainIDs

**Cannot mature bond**

- Verify current timestamp exceeds maturity date
- Check your address has GOVERNANCE_ROLE
- Ensure bond not already matured

**Mint fails for specific recipient**

- Verify recipient OnchainID registered in identity registry
- Check recipient has all required claims (accredited status, KYC level,
  jurisdiction)
- Confirm recipient not on blocklist
