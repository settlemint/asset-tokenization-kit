## Before you start

**Prerequisites:**

- Completed [Getting started](/docs/user-guides/onboarding/getting-started)
  onboarding
- Fund system factory deployed during onboarding
- Fund prospectus and investment terms prepared
- Regulatory framework determined (40 Act, UCITS, AIFMD, or custom)

**Time estimate:** 15-20 minutes for fund deployment; additional time for NAV
and fee configuration

**Required knowledge:**

- Basic blockchain wallet operations
- Understanding of investment funds and NAV calculation
- Familiarity with fund regulations (1940 Act, UCITS, AIFMD, etc.)
- Fund administration operations

## Steps

<Steps>

<Step>

### 1. Navigate to fund creation

From your dashboard:

1. Click **Asset Management** in the left sidebar
2. Select **Funds** from the asset type list
3. Click **Create New Fund Token**

![Fund creation navigation](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Asset Management section showing Funds category with existing funds list and
Create New Fund Token button_

</Step>

<Step>

### 2. Configure fund parameters

#### Basic token information

Enter your token details:

- **Token name** - Full legal name (e.g., "Global Growth Fund Class A Shares")
- **Token symbol** - Trading symbol (e.g., "GGFA")
- **Decimals** - Token divisibility (18 for fractional units, 0 for whole units)
- **Initial supply** - Number of units to mint at deployment (typically 0 for
  funds)

![Fund basic information](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Fund
configuration form showing name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply fields
with validation_

**Naming tip:** Include fund name and share class (Class A/B/C,
institutional/retail) for clear identification.

#### Fund-specific parameters

Configure your investment fund properties:

**Fund type**

Select fund structure:

- **Open-end fund** - Continuous subscription and redemption (mutual funds)
- **Closed-end fund** - Fixed capitalization with secondary market trading
- **Interval fund** - Periodic redemption windows

**Share class configuration**

Define class characteristics:

- **Management fee** - Annual fee percentage (entered as basis points)
- **Performance fee** - Carried interest or incentive fee (if applicable)
- **Minimum investment** - Minimum initial subscription amount
- **Redemption notice period** - Days notice required for redemption requests

![Fund type and class configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Fund parameters showing fund type dropdown, management fee input,
performance fee toggle, and minimum investment field_

**Management fee examples:**

- 1% annual = 100 basis points
- 1.5% annual = 150 basis points
- 2% annual = 200 basis points

#### NAV tracking setup

Configure your net asset value management:

**NAV calculation**

- **Initial NAV** - Starting NAV per unit (typically 100.00 or 1,000.00)
- **NAV currency** - Denomination currency (USD, EUR, etc.)
- **Valuation frequency** - Daily, weekly, or monthly NAV updates

**NAV oracle**

Link to price feed source:

1. **Manual NAV updates** - Administrator posts NAV values
2. **Oracle integration** - Automated NAV from external data provider
3. **Hybrid** - Oracle with administrator override capability

![NAV configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: NAV
settings showing initial NAV input, currency selector, valuation frequency
dropdown, and oracle integration options_

The system uses NAV for subscription/redemption pricing calculations.

<Callout type="info" title="Business context">
  Traditional fund administration requires manual NAV calculation across
  multiple spreadsheets, reconciliation with custodian records, and distribution
  to multiple systems. This process typically takes 1-3 business days and costs
  $5,000-50,000 monthly depending on fund complexity. ATK's automated NAV
  posting enables same-day subscription/redemption processing and reduces
  administrative overhead by 70-85%.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### 3. Configure subscription and redemption

Fund units require special issuance and withdrawal workflows.

#### Subscription settings

Define how your investors purchase fund units:

**Subscription process**

- **Minimum initial investment** - First purchase minimum (e.g., $10,000)
- **Minimum subsequent investment** - Additional purchase minimum (e.g., $1,000)
- **Subscription settlement** - T+0, T+1, T+2, T+3 settlement cycle
- **Cut-off time** - Daily deadline for subscription orders

**Payment methods**

Configure accepted payment tokens:

- Add stablecoin addresses (USDC, USDT, etc.)
- Set payment token conversion rates to NAV currency
- Enable multi-currency subscriptions (optional)

![Subscription configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Subscription settings showing minimum investment amounts, settlement cycle
selector, cut-off time picker, and payment token list_

#### Redemption settings

Configure how your investors exit the fund:

**Redemption process**

- **Redemption notice period** - Days advance notice required (e.g., 5 business
  days)
- **Redemption frequency** - Daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly redemptions
- **Redemption fee** - Early redemption penalty (if applicable, in basis points)
- **Redemption settlement** - T+1, T+3, T+5, T+7 settlement cycle

**Redemption restrictions**

Set withdrawal limits:

- **Minimum redemption** - Minimum withdrawal amount
- **Partial redemption minimum** - Minimum balance remaining after partial
  redemption
- **Gates** - Maximum percentage of fund redeemable per period (e.g., 25%
  quarterly)
- **Lock-up period** - Mandatory holding period before first redemption allowed

![Redemption configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Redemption settings showing notice period, frequency, fees, settlement cycle,
and restriction inputs_

**Hedge fund example:** 90-day lock-up, quarterly redemptions with 45-day
notice, 25% quarterly gate.

</Step>

<Step>

### 4. Set compliance rules

Your fund token enforces investor eligibility and transfer restrictions.

#### Regulatory framework selection

Choose your applicable regulatory framework:

- **1940 Act** - US registered investment company
- **Regulation D** - US private fund (accredited/qualified purchasers)
- **UCITS** - European harmonized fund
- **AIFMD** - Alternative investment fund (EU)
- **Custom** - Jurisdiction-specific compliance

**Note:** Selecting a framework provides pre-configured compliance modules. You
can customize individual modules after deployment.

![Compliance framework selection](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Regulatory framework cards showing 1940 Act, Reg D, UCITS, AIFMD,
and Custom options with investor eligibility summaries_

#### Configure compliance modules

Based on your selected framework, configure these modules:

**Investor eligibility**

Set OnchainID claim requirements:

- **Accredited investor** status (Reg D private funds)
- **Qualified purchaser** status (3(c)(7) funds)
- **Professional investor** status (AIFMD)
- **Suitability assessment** completion
- **KYC/AML verification** level

Only addresses with all required claims can subscribe to fund units.

**Transfer restrictions**

Configure secondary transfer rules:

- **Transferability** - Enable/disable secondary market transfers
- **Transfer approval** - Require fund manager approval for all transfers
- **Lock-up enforcement** - Prevent transfers during lock-up period
- **Maximum holders** - Cap total investor count (e.g., 99 for 3(c)(1) funds)

![Compliance module configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Compliance modules showing Investor Eligibility, Transfer
Restrictions, and Lock-up Period panels with configuration options_

**3(c)(1) vs 3(c)(7):** 3(c)(1) allows up to 99 investors (accredited required);
3(c)(7) allows unlimited qualified purchasers.

#### Geographic restrictions

Limit fund access by jurisdiction:

1. Enable **Country Allow List** module
2. Select permitted investor countries
3. Configure distribution restrictions per UCITS/AIFMD passporting rules

</Step>

<Step>

### 5. Assign operational roles

Grant permissions for fund management.

#### Role assignments

Assign wallet addresses to these fund-specific roles:

**GOVERNANCE_ROLE**

Manages fund compliance and operations:

- Configure compliance modules
- Update investor eligibility requirements
- Approve/reject subscription requests
- Configure redemption parameters
- Post NAV updates

Typically assigned to: Fund administrator or compliance officer wallet

**SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE**

Controls fund unit supply:

- Mint units (process subscriptions)
- Burn units (process redemptions)
- Execute NAV-based issuance calculations

Typically assigned to: Fund operations or treasury wallet

**CUSTODIAN_ROLE**

Handles investor account operations:

- Freeze compromised accounts
- Execute forced transfers (regulatory orders)
- Recover lost units

Typically assigned to: Fund custodian or transfer agent wallet

**EMERGENCY_ROLE**

Emergency interventions:

- Pause all transfers and subscriptions/redemptions
- Implement fund gates during market stress
- Unpause after incident resolution

Typically assigned to: Fund manager wallet

![Role assignment interface](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Role assignment form showing four roles with address inputs, role descriptions,
and permission lists_

**Best practice:** Use multisig wallets for GOVERNANCE_ROLE and EMERGENCY_ROLE
to prevent unilateral critical actions.

</Step>

<Step>

### 6. Review and deploy

#### Deploy fund contract

Execute your deployment:

1. Click **Deploy Fund Token**
2. Review the transaction details
3. Enter your PIN or OTP to authenticate
4. Confirm the transaction

Your deployment will:

1. Deploy the fund proxy contract (15-20 seconds)
2. Initialize with your parameters (10 seconds)
3. Configure NAV tracking (5 seconds)
4. Assign roles to your specified addresses (5 seconds per role)
5. Register with the identity registry (10 seconds)

**Total deployment time:** 60-90 seconds

![Deployment progress](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:

and timestamps_

</Step>

<Step>

### 7. Post-issuance actions

After your successful deployment:

#### Verify deployment

1. Note the contract address
2. Click **View Fund Token** to navigate to details page
3. Verify configuration:
   - Token information correct
   - Management fee rate matches
   - NAV tracking enabled
   - Roles assigned correctly

![Fund details overview](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Fund
token details page showing key metrics, NAV information, fee schedule, AUM, and
investor count_

#### Set initial NAV

Post your first net asset value:

1. Navigate to **NAV** tab
2. Click **Update NAV**
3. Enter NAV per unit (typically your configured initial NAV)
4. Enter effective date and time
5. Confirm update

The NAV appears on your fund details page and is used for
subscription/redemption calculations.

#### Configure fee collection

Set up your management fee collection:

1. Navigate to **Fees** tab
2. Review fee schedule showing management fee percentage
3. Configure fee collection wallet address
4. Set fee collection frequency (monthly, quarterly, annually)
5. Enable automated fee collection (optional)

**Fee calculation:** Management fees accrue daily based on AUM and collect
periodically by minting new units to fee wallet.

#### Enable subscriptions

Open your fund for investor subscriptions:

1. Navigate to **Settings** tab
2. Toggle **Accept Subscriptions** to enabled
3. Confirm subscription parameters correct
4. Review payment token addresses
5. Save changes

Your investors can now submit subscription requests.

</Step>

<Step>

### 8. Manage fund operations

#### Process subscription requests

Handle your investor purchase orders:

**Subscription workflow:**

1. Investor submits subscription request via dApp:
   - Enters investment amount
   - Selects payment token
   - Transfers payment to fund subscription wallet
2. Request appears in **Subscriptions** queue
3. Navigate to **Subscriptions** &gt; **Pending**
4. Review request details:
   - Investor identity and compliance status
   - Investment amount and payment token
   - Applicable NAV (based on cut-off time)
   - Unit quantity calculation
5. Click **Approve** or **Reject**

**Approval actions:**

- The system calculates units: investment amount / NAV per unit
- Issues calculated units to investor address
- Records subscription in fund ledger
- Updates total AUM

<Callout type="info" title="Business context">
  Traditional subscription processing requires the fund administrator to
  manually calculate unit quantities, coordinate with the transfer agent to
  update the registry, reconcile with the custodian's records, and send
  confirmation notices. This workflow typically takes 3-5 business days (T+3 or
  T+5 settlement). ATK automates the entire process with T+0 or T+1 settlement,
  reducing operational costs by 80-90%.
</Callout>

![Subscription queue](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Subscription requests table showing pending orders with investor, amount,
payment token, NAV, calculated units, and approve/reject buttons_

**Cut-off time handling:** Requests received before cut-off use same-day NAV;
requests after cut-off use next-day NAV. The system applies these rules
automatically, eliminating manual NAV assignment errors.

#### Update net asset value

Maintain accurate fund pricing:

**Manual NAV posting:**

1. Calculate fund NAV:
   - Sum all portfolio asset values
   - Subtract liabilities and accrued fees
   - Divide by total outstanding units
2. Navigate to **NAV** &gt; **Update NAV**
3. Enter new NAV per unit
4. Enter effective date/time
5. Provide calculation source/notes
6. Confirm update

**NAV validation:** The system prevents NAV updates that deviate more than a
configurable threshold (e.g., 10%) from the previous NAV without additional
confirmation, protecting against data entry errors.

<Callout type="default" title="For developers">
  See [Contract
  Reference](/docs/developer-guides/smart-contracts/contract-reference) for
  technical details on NAV oracle integration and validation thresholds.
</Callout>

**Oracle integration:**

For automated NAV updates:

1. Configure oracle data feed
2. Set update frequency
3. Enable automated posting
4. Monitor oracle health on **NAV** tab

The system posts NAV automatically based on oracle data, eliminating manual data
entry and reducing the risk of pricing errors.

![NAV update interface](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: NAV
update form showing NAV per unit input, effective date/time, calculation notes,
and historical NAV chart_

#### Process redemption requests

Handle your investor withdrawal orders:

**Redemption workflow:**

1. Investor submits redemption request via dApp:
   - Enters unit quantity to redeem
   - Selects payout token
   - Confirms redemption notice period
2. Request enters **Redemptions** &gt; **Pending Notice** queue
3. After notice period expires, request moves to **Ready for Processing**
4. Navigate to **Redemptions** &gt; **Ready**
5. Review request details:
   - Investor address
   - Unit quantity
   - Applicable NAV
   - Redemption proceeds calculation
   - Payout token
6. Ensure fund liquidity wallet has sufficient payout tokens
7. Click **Process Redemption**

**Processing actions:**

- The system calculates proceeds: units × NAV per unit
- Burns redeemed units from investor address
- Transfers payout tokens from fund liquidity wallet to investor
- Records redemption in fund ledger
- Updates total AUM

<Callout type="info" title="Business context">
  Traditional redemption processing requires the fund administrator to manually
  calculate redemption proceeds, coordinate with the custodian to release cash,
  update unit holder records with the transfer agent, and reconcile all systems.
  This process typically takes 3-7 business days and introduces reconciliation
  errors in 10-15% of cases. ATK automates the entire workflow with T+1 or T+2
  settlement and zero calculation errors.
</Callout>

![Redemption queue](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Redemption
requests showing notice period countdown, ready requests with investor, units,
NAV, proceeds, and process button_

**Gate enforcement:** If redemption requests exceed your quarterly gate (e.g.,
25%), the system pro-rates all requests or queues excess for the next period,
automatically implementing the gate policy defined in your fund documents.

#### Collect management fees

Execute fee collection:

**Automated fee collection:**

If enabled, the system automatically:

1. Calculates accrued fees daily: (AUM × fee rate) / 365
2. On collection date, issues new units to your fee wallet
3. Unit quantity: total accrued fees / current NAV
4. Records fee event in fund history

<Callout type="default" title="For developers">
  See [Contract
  Reference](/docs/developer-guides/smart-contracts/contract-reference) for
  technical details on management fee calculation and accrual mechanisms.
</Callout>

**Manual fee collection:**

1. Navigate to **Fees** tab
2. Review accrued fees amount
3. Click **Collect Fees**
4. Confirm fee calculation
5. Execute collection

Fee collection dilutes existing investors proportionally.

**Performance fee calculation:**

For funds with performance fees:

1. Calculate high water mark
2. Determine fund performance above benchmark
3. Calculate performance fee: outperformance × performance fee rate
4. Mint units to manager fee wallet
5. Update high water mark

#### Manage fund liquidity

Monitor your redemption reserve:

1. Navigate to **Liquidity** tab
2. Review liquidity metrics:
   - Total redemption requests pending
   - Required liquidity for upcoming redemptions
   - Current cash/stablecoin reserves
   - Portfolio liquidity composition
3. Ensure sufficient reserves before redemption settlement dates

**Best practice:** Maintain liquidity buffer of 10-20% of AUM for redemption
capacity.

### Common workflows

**Handle new investor onboarding:**

Add a new fund investor:

1. Investor completes KYC via platform or integrated provider
2. Investor's OnchainID receives required claims (accredited status, suitability
   assessment)
3. Verify investor appears in **Eligible Investors** list
4. Investor submits subscription request
5. Process subscription per workflow above

**Execute fund restructuring:**

Merge share classes or convert fund:

1. Obtain investor consent for restructuring
2. Calculate conversion ratios based on NAV
3. Navigate to **Actions** &gt; **Restructure**
4. Configure conversion parameters
5. Execute batch conversion
6. Mint new class units and burn old class units
7. Record restructuring in corporate actions

**Implement redemption gate:**

Limit redemptions during market stress:

1. Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Redemptions**
2. Click **Activate Gate**
3. Set gate parameters:
   - Maximum redemption percentage per period
   - Gate duration
4. Confirm activation
5. Platform pro-rates pending redemption requests
6. Notify investors of gate implementation

Requires EMERGENCY_ROLE permission.

**Process dividend distribution:**

Distribute fund income to your investors:

**For funds with yield addon:**

1. Calculate distribution amount (income/capital gains)
2. Navigate to **Distributions** tab
3. Click **Schedule Distribution**
4. Configure:
   - Distribution token (USDC, USDT, etc.)
   - Amount per unit
   - Ex-dividend date
   - Payment date
5. Fund distribution wallet with total amount
6. Execute distribution on payment date

**Reinvestment option:**

Enable dividend reinvestment:

1. Toggle **Allow Reinvestment** on distribution
2. Investors opt into reinvestment via dApp
3. Platform mints new units instead of transferring tokens
4. Units minted at current NAV

</Step>

</Steps>

## Results

After completing these steps, you will have:

- A deployed fund token contract with your specified fund type and share class
- Configured NAV tracking with manual or oracle-based updates
- Set subscription and redemption workflows with your terms
- Configured compliance rules matching your regulatory framework
- Assigned operational roles to designated wallet addresses
- Posted initial NAV and enabled investor subscriptions
- Configured management fee collection

Your fund token is now live and can accept investor subscriptions. You'll
process subscription/redemption requests through your admin dashboard, update
NAV regularly, and collect management fees automatically or manually.

## Troubleshooting

**Deployment fails with "Invalid management fee":**

- Verify the fee is in basis points (not percentage)
- Check the fee is within allowed range (typically 0-500 basis points)
- Ensure the fee rate matches your configured maximum

**Subscription processing reverts:**

- Verify the investor's OnchainID has all required claims
- Check the payment token is configured for subscriptions
- Ensure NAV is posted for the subscription settlement date
- Confirm the investor is not exceeding maximum holder count

**NAV update fails:**

- Verify NAV deviation is within the allowed threshold
- Check your address has GOVERNANCE_ROLE
- Ensure the NAV timestamp is after the previous NAV
- Confirm the NAV value is positive and reasonable

**Redemption processing reverts:**

- Check the notice period has elapsed
- Verify your fund liquidity wallet has sufficient payout tokens
- Ensure the redemption is not exceeding gate limits
- Confirm the investor holds sufficient units to redeem

**Fee collection fails:**

- Verify fee collection is enabled in settings
- Check the accrued fee amount is non-zero
- Ensure sufficient time has elapsed since last collection
- Confirm NAV is current for fee unit calculation
