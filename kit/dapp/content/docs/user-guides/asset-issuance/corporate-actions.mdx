## Steps

### Dividend distributions

Pay cash or stock dividends to your equity holders.

#### Plan dividend distribution

Determine your dividend parameters:

1. Navigate to token details: **Asset Management** &gt; **Equity** &gt; [Token
   Name]
2. Click **Actions** &gt; **Distributions** &gt; **New Distribution**
3. Configure dividend:
   - **Distribution type** - Cash (token payment) or stock (additional shares)
   - **Amount per share** - Dividend amount per token held
   - **Payment token** - USDC, USDT, or other ERC20 (for cash dividends)
   - **Ex-dividend date** - Last day to hold shares to receive dividend
   - **Record date** - Snapshot date for eligible shareholders
   - **Payment date** - When distribution executes

![Dividend configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Dividend distribution configuration showing distribution type, amount per share,
dates, and payment token selection_

**Date definitions:**

- **Ex-dividend date:** Shares purchased after this date don't receive dividend
- **Record date:** Shareholders on this date are eligible
- **Payment date:** When dividend is actually distributed

**Example:**

- Ex-dividend: April 1
- Record date: April 3
- Payment date: April 15
- Shareholders owning stock April 3 receive dividend April 15

#### Fund dividend wallet

Prepare your distribution tokens:

For cash dividends:

1. Calculate total distribution amount:
   - Total shares outstanding × dividend per share = total distribution
2. Navigate to **Distributions** &gt; [Distribution Name] &gt; **Funding**
3. Note dividend wallet address
4. Transfer total distribution amount of payment token to dividend wallet
5. Verify balance sufficient:
   - Platform shows required vs. actual balance
   - Green indicator when fully funded

![Dividend funding](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Dividend
funding showing required amount, dividend wallet address, current balance, and
funding status indicator_

**Timing:** Fund dividend wallet at least 48 hours before payment date.

### Execute dividend distribution

Process dividend payment:

On payment date:

1. Navigate to **Distributions** &gt; [Distribution Name]
2. Review distribution summary:
   - Eligible shareholders count
   - Total distribution amount
   - Per-share distribution
   - Funding status
3. Click **Execute Distribution**
4. Platform:
   - Takes snapshot of shareholders as of record date
   - Calculates pro-rata distribution for each holder
   - Transfers payment token from dividend wallet to each holder
   - Records distribution transactions
   - Updates distribution status to "Complete"
5. Review distribution results:
   - Successful payments count
   - Failed payments (if any)
   - Total amount distributed

![Distribution execution](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Distribution execution showing eligible shareholders list with calculated
amounts and execution progress_

**Scheduled execution:** Configure automatic entitlement calculation on payment
date to eliminate manual spreadsheet work.

<Callout type="info" title="Business context">
  Traditional distribution execution requires the corporate secretary to
  manually calculate each shareholder's entitlement, prepare payment
  instructions for dozens or hundreds of transfers, coordinate with the transfer
  agent, and reconcile which payments completed. This manual process typically
  requires 3-5 business days and introduces calculation errors in 15-20% of
  cases. ATK automates the entire flow with sub-second execution and zero
  calculation errors.
</Callout>

### Stock dividends

Issue additional shares as dividend:

For stock dividends (e.g., 10% stock dividend):

1. Configure distribution with type "Stock"
2. Enter shares per share ratio (e.g., 0.10 for 10% stock dividend)
3. Set ex-dividend and record dates
4. On payment date, click **Execute Distribution**
5. Platform:
   - Snapshots shareholders
   - Calculates additional shares: holdings × ratio
   - Mints new shares to each holder
   - Updates total supply
   - Records distribution

**Dilution:** Stock dividends increase total shares; per-share value adjusts
proportionally.

### Coupon payments

Pay interest on bond tokens:

### Configure yield schedule

Set up scheduled bond interest calculations:

For bonds with yield module:

1. Navigate to bond token: **Asset Management** &gt; **Bonds** &gt; [Bond Name]
2. Navigate to **Yield** tab
3. Click **Configure Schedule**
4. Set payment parameters:
   - **Payment frequency** - Quarterly, semi-annual, annual
   - **Annual yield rate** - Coupon rate (basis points)
   - **Yield token** - Denomination asset (USDC, USDT)
   - **First payment date** - Initial coupon date
   - **Yield basis** - Face value or current principal
5. Click **Save Schedule**

![Yield schedule](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Yield
schedule configuration showing payment frequency, rate, token, and calculated
payment dates_

**Accrual calculation:** The system calculates daily accrual and makes
entitlements claimable on payment dates, eliminating manual interest
calculations.

<Callout type="info" title="Business context">
  Traditional bond servicing requires the paying agent to manually calculate
  each bondholder's coupon payment based on their holdings, prepare wire
  transfer instructions, send payments through the banking system, and reconcile
  which payments cleared. This process typically takes 5-10 business days per
  payment date and costs $50-150 per bondholder in servicing fees. ATK enables
  instant claim-based distribution where bondholders pull their payments
  on-demand, reducing operational costs by 85-95%.
</Callout>

### Fund yield wallet

Ensure sufficient reserves for coupon payments:

1. Navigate to **Yield** tab
2. Review upcoming payments:
   - Next payment date
   - Required payment amount
   - Current yield wallet balance
3. Calculate shortfall if any
4. Transfer yield tokens to yield wallet address
5. Verify funding adequate

**Calculation example:**

- Total bonds outstanding: 1,000,000
- Face value per bond: $1,000
- Annual coupon: 5%
- Quarterly payment: (1,000,000 × $1,000 × 5%) / 4 = $12,500,000

### Execute coupon payment

Process scheduled interest payment:

**Automated processing:**

If automatic execution enabled:

1. On payment date, platform automatically:
   - Snapshots bond holders
   - Calculates pro-rata interest for each holder
   - Transfers yield tokens from yield wallet
   - Records payment transactions
2. Review payment results on **Yield** &gt; **Payment History**

**Manual processing:**

If manual execution required:

1. Navigate to **Yield** &gt; **Scheduled Payments**
2. Select payment due
3. Click **Execute Payment**
4. Confirm execution
5. Platform processes payment per automated flow above

![Coupon payment history](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:

and transaction hashes_

### Token splits and consolidations

Adjust token denomination:

### Execute token split

Increase share count, decrease per-share value:

For stock splits (e.g., 2-for-1 split):

1. Navigate to equity token details
2. Click **Actions** &gt; **Token Split**
3. Enter split ratio:
   - **Numerator** - New shares per old share (2 for 2-for-1 split)
   - **Denominator** - Old shares (1 for 2-for-1 split)
4. Set effective date
5. Review impact:
   - New total supply = current supply × (numerator / denominator)
   - Holder balances multiply by (numerator / denominator)
6. Click **Execute Split**
7. Platform:
   - Snapshots current holders and balances
   - Mints additional tokens to each holder
   - Updates total supply
   - Records split event

**Post-split:**

- Shareholders have more tokens
- Token price adjusts proportionally
- Ownership percentages unchanged

<Callout type="default" title="For developers">
  See [Contract
  Reference](/docs/developer-guides/smart-contracts/contract-reference) for
  technical details on how the token split mechanism adjusts balances while
  maintaining proportional ownership.
</Callout>

### Reverse split

Decrease share count, increase per-share value:

For reverse splits (e.g., 1-for-10 reverse split):

1. Navigate to equity token details
2. Click **Actions** &gt; **Token Split**
3. Enter split ratio:
   - **Numerator** - New shares (1 for 1-for-10)
   - **Denominator** - Old shares required (10 for 1-for-10)
4. Set effective date
5. Click **Execute Split**
6. Platform:
   - Snapshots holders
   - Burns tokens proportionally
   - Issues fewer tokens back
   - Updates supply

**Fractional shares:** The system handles fractional shares automatically;
consider rounding rules for small holders to avoid dust amounts.

- Monitor wallet balances continuously

**Execution:**

- Execute on scheduled dates consistently
- Schedule recurring distribution calculations when possible
- Verify distributions complete successfully
- Investigate failed distributions immediately

**Record keeping:**

- Maintain audit trail of all corporate actions
- Archive shareholder snapshots for each action
- Document approvals and authorizations
- Retain records per regulatory requirements (typically 7 years)

**Compliance:**

- Ensure corporate actions approved per governance requirements
- File required regulatory disclosures (8-K, etc.)
- Verify tax reporting for distributions
- Coordinate with transfer agent and legal counsel

## Results

**Vote transaction fails:**

- Verify you held shares at the proposal creation block
- Check the proposal is still in the voting period
- Ensure you haven't already voted on this proposal
- Confirm your voting power > 0

**Bond redemption not available:**

- Verify the bond has reached maturity date
- Check the bond matured status is set correctly
- Ensure your redemption wallet is funded
- Confirm you hold bond tokens

**Yield payment failed:**

- Check your yield wallet has sufficient yield tokens
- Verify the yield schedule is configured correctly
- Ensure bondholders have verified OnchainIDs
