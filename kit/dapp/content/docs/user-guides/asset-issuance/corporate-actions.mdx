**Primary audience:** Corporate treasurers, CFOs  
**Secondary audience:** Investor relations teams, asset managers

Corporate actions traditionally require manual spreadsheet calculations, paying
agent coordination, multi-day settlement cycles, and reconciliation workflows
that fail 15-20% of the time. The platform automates entitlement calculations,
snapshot mechanics, and token distributions through programmable smart contracts
with sub-second execution and zero calculation errors.

This guide walks through executing corporate actions across asset types—dividend
distributions, coupon payments, redemptions, governance votes, and fund
distributions—with built-in observability and vault-based settlement.

## Before you start

Confirm your asset is deployed and holders have completed identity verification.
Corporate actions require funded vaults for cash distributions and configured
yield schedules for interest-bearing assets.

**Prerequisites:**

- Issued tokens per asset-specific guides
- Funded distribution or yield wallet (48-hour minimum before payment date)
- Shareholder communication plan with 30-day advance notice
- Understanding of corporate action type and shareholder impact

**Time estimate:** 15-30 minutes for governance proposals; 30-60 minutes for
dividend distribution with vault funding verification

**Required knowledge:**

- Corporate finance and shareholder rights
- Token holder communication procedures
- Regulatory requirements for corporate actions (8-K filing, tax reporting)

## Understanding automated distributions

The platform eliminates manual entitlement calculations through snapshot-based
distribution mechanics. When you configure a dividend, coupon payment, or fund
distribution, the system automatically captures holder balances at the record
date, calculates pro-rata entitlements for each holder, and executes transfers
from the distribution vault to all eligible holders in a single transaction
batch.

Traditional distribution execution requires the corporate secretary to manually
calculate each shareholder's entitlement, prepare payment instructions for
dozens or hundreds of transfers, coordinate with the transfer agent, and
reconcile which payments completed. This manual process typically requires 3-5
business days and introduces calculation errors in 15-20% of cases.

The platform automates the entire flow with sub-second execution and zero
calculation errors. You configure dates and fund the vault; the system handles
snapshot capture, entitlement calculation, atomic settlement, and audit trail
recording.

<Callout type="info" title="Observability">
  Monitor distribution execution in the Distributions dashboard. The panel shows
  pending actions, funding status (required vs. actual balance), holder counts,
  and execution history with transaction hashes. Set up alerts for underfunded
  vaults 48 hours before payment dates.
</Callout>

## The end-to-end distribution lifecycle

Walk through the complete corporate action lifecycle using a bond coupon payment
scenario. This narrative demonstrates how yield automation, vault funding,
snapshot mechanics, and atomic settlement combine to eliminate manual servicing
work.

### When a bond reaches its coupon date

Your company issued $10 million in tokenized bonds with a 5% annual coupon,
payable quarterly. The next coupon payment date is April 15. As treasury
operator, you need to pay $125,000 in interest to 200+ bondholders without
manual entitlement calculations or wire transfer coordination.

The platform's yield module handles this workflow automatically through
scheduled payment execution. You configured the yield schedule at bond issuance
(payment frequency, rate, denomination token), so the system already knows the
payment amount and date. Your only manual tasks are vault funding and payment
verification.

### Funding the yield vault

Two days before the payment date, navigate to **Asset Management** &gt;
**Bonds** &gt; [Bond Name] &gt; **Yield** tab. The platform shows the upcoming
payment summary:

- **Payment date:** April 15
- **Required amount:** $125,000 USDC
- **Current yield wallet balance:** $0 USDC
- **Status:** Underfunded (red indicator)

Transfer $125,000 USDC from your treasury wallet to the displayed yield wallet
address. The funding status indicator updates to green when the vault holds
sufficient reserves. The platform calculates the required amount automatically
based on outstanding bond supply × (annual rate / payment frequency).

<Callout type="warning" title="Reserve buffers">
  Fund distribution vaults with a 5-10% buffer above the calculated requirement
  to account for accrual rounding and holders who acquire bonds between snapshot
  and payment date. Underfunded vaults cause payment failures that require
  manual remediation.
</Callout>

### Automated snapshot and entitlement calculation

At midnight UTC on the record date (April 13), the platform automatically
snapshots all bondholder balances from the unified token registry. The snapshot
captures:

- Holder addresses with verified OnchainIDs
- Bond balance per holder at block height
- Compliance status (eligible vs. restricted transfers)
- Total outstanding supply at snapshot time

The system then calculates each holder's pro-rata entitlement:

```
Holder entitlement = (holder balance / total supply) × total payment amount
```

For a holder owning 50,000 bonds out of 1,000,000 total supply:

```
(50,000 / 1,000,000) × $125,000 = $6,250 USDC
```

These calculations happen automatically in smart contract logic with zero manual
intervention. The entitlements are recorded on-chain and become claimable at the
payment date.

### Payment execution and settlement

On April 15 at the scheduled payment time, the platform executes the
distribution:

1. Validates yield vault holds sufficient USDC balance
2. Iterates through the snapshotted holder list
3. Transfers each holder's calculated entitlement from vault to holder wallet
4. Records payment transactions with transaction hashes
5. Updates distribution status to "Complete"
6. Emits payment events for audit trail

All transfers occur atomically in a single transaction batch. Either all holders
receive their payments successfully or the entire distribution reverts—there are
no partial settlement scenarios that require manual reconciliation.

View payment results in **Yield** &gt; **Payment History**. The dashboard shows
successful payment count, total distributed amount, failed payment addresses (if
any), gas costs, and transaction hash for the distribution batch.

<Callout type="info" title="Business context">
  Traditional bond servicing requires the paying agent to manually calculate
  each bondholder's coupon payment based on their holdings, prepare wire
  transfer instructions, send payments through the banking system, and reconcile
  which payments cleared. This process typically takes 5-10 business days per
  payment date and costs $50-150 per bondholder in servicing fees. The platform
  enables instant claim-based distribution where bondholders pull their payments
  on-demand, reducing operational costs by 85-95%.
</Callout>

### Monitoring and observability integration

After distribution execution, verify completion in the Compliance Metrics
dashboard:

- **Distribution success rate:** 98.7% (197 of 200 holders paid)
- **Failed payments:** 3 holders (compliance restrictions)
- **Total distributed:** $123,125 USDC
- **Gas cost:** $12.50 (0.01% of distribution amount)
- **Execution time:** 2.3 seconds

Failed payments typically indicate compliance issues (holder identity
verification expired, restricted transfer rules). The dashboard links failed
addresses directly to the OnchainID verification panel for remediation.

Set up automated alerts in the monitoring panel for:

- Vault funding status (48-hour pre-payment notification)
- Distribution execution completion
- Failed payment threshold (alert if &gt; 5% failure rate)
- Upcoming scheduled payments (7-day advance notice)

## Dividend distributions for equity

Pay cash or stock dividends to equity holders using the same snapshot and
settlement mechanics. The workflow differs from coupon payments in timing
flexibility—you configure custom ex-dividend, record, and payment dates rather
than relying on preset yield schedules.

### Configuring dividend parameters

Navigate to **Asset Management** &gt; **Equity** &gt; [Token Name] &gt;
**Actions** &gt; **Distributions** &gt; **New Distribution**.

Configure the dividend structure:

- **Distribution type:** Cash (token payment) or stock (additional shares)
- **Amount per share:** $2.50 dividend per equity token held
- **Payment token:** USDC, USDT, or other ERC-20 denomination asset
- **Ex-dividend date:** April 1 (last day to purchase shares and receive
  dividend)
- **Record date:** April 3 (snapshot date for eligible shareholders)
- **Payment date:** April 15 (when distribution executes)

The date sequence enforces regulatory settlement timing (T+2 in U.S. markets).
Shareholders owning equity tokens at the record date block height receive
dividends on the payment date, regardless of whether they sell shares between
record and payment dates.

For a company with 1,000,000 outstanding shares paying a $2.50 dividend:

```
Total distribution = 1,000,000 × $2.50 = $2,500,000 USDC
```

Fund the dividend wallet with $2,500,000 USDC at least 48 hours before the
payment date. The platform verifies funding adequacy and displays a green
indicator when reserves are sufficient.

### Stock dividends and dilution mechanics

For stock dividends (issuing additional shares instead of cash), configure
distribution type "Stock" with a shares-per-share ratio. A 10% stock dividend
means each holder receives 0.10 additional shares per share held.

On the payment date, the platform:

1. Snapshots shareholder balances at the record date block
2. Calculates additional shares: holder balance × dividend ratio
3. Mints new shares to each holder's wallet
4. Increases total supply proportionally
5. Records the stock dividend event

A shareholder holding 1,000 shares receives 100 additional shares (1,000 ×
0.10). Total supply increases from 1,000,000 to 1,100,000 shares. Per-share
value adjusts proportionally to maintain market capitalization—if shares traded
at $50 before the dividend, they adjust to approximately $45.45 after ($50 /
1.10).

Stock dividends are dilutive to share price but not to ownership percentage. All
shareholders receive proportional increases in share count, maintaining their
relative ownership stakes.

## Bond redemptions and DvP settlement

Handle bond maturity and early redemption through atomic delivery-versus-payment
settlement. The platform's vault architecture ensures simultaneous exchange of
bond tokens and denomination assets, eliminating settlement risk.

### Processing bond maturity

When bonds reach their maturity date, redemption becomes available to all
holders. Navigate to **Asset Management** &gt; **Bonds** &gt; [Bond Name] &gt;
**Actions** tab and review maturity details:

- **Maturity date:** December 31, 2025
- **Outstanding bonds:** 1,000,000 units
- **Face value per bond:** $1,000
- **Total redemption amount:** $1,000,000,000 USDC
- **Redemption vault balance:** $0 (underfunded)

Transfer the full redemption amount ($1 billion USDC) to the redemption vault
address displayed in the panel. This is the platform's critical
differentiator—traditional bond redemptions require coordinating wire transfers
to hundreds of bondholders over multiple days. The vault architecture enables
instant atomic settlement.

After the maturity date passes, click **Mature Bond** to activate redemption for
all holders. This marks the bond as matured on-chain and enables the redemption
function for bondholder wallets.

### Bondholder redemption flow

Bondholders initiate redemption through the dApp investor portal:

1. Navigate to **My Holdings** &gt; [Bond Name]
2. Click **Redeem Bonds**
3. Enter redemption amount (full balance or partial)
4. Confirm transaction

The smart contract executes delivery-versus-payment in a single atomic
transaction:

1. Validates holder owns bond tokens to redeem
2. Validates redemption vault holds sufficient USDC balance
3. Burns bond tokens from holder wallet
4. Transfers denomination asset (USDC) from vault to holder wallet
5. Records redemption with transaction hash

Both legs settle simultaneously—the bondholder receives USDC if and only if
their bond tokens burn successfully. This atomic settlement eliminates
counterparty risk where traditional finance requires 3-5 day settlement windows
with credit exposure.

<Callout type="info" title="DALP differentiator">
  Atomic DvP settlement through vault-based architecture is a core
  protocol-level capability. Traditional systems require trusted intermediaries
  (custodians, paying agents) to coordinate settlement timing and mitigate
  counterparty risk. The platform's smart contract enforces simultaneous
  exchange, eliminating settlement risk entirely.
</Callout>

### Optional redemption (callable bonds)

For bonds with call provisions, issuers can redeem bonds before maturity at a
specified call price. Navigate to **Actions** &gt; **Call Bonds** and configure:

- **Call date:** March 1, 2025 (early redemption date)
- **Call price:** 102% of par ($1,020 per $1,000 bond)
- **Notice period:** 30 days (bondholder notification requirement)
- **Partial call:** Optional (call subset of outstanding bonds)

Issue the call notice 30 days before the call date. The platform notifies
bondholders through the dApp and records the call parameters on-chain. On the
call date, execute redemption using the same atomic DvP mechanics—bond tokens
burn and call price transfers from vault to holders simultaneously.

Callable bond features enable dynamic capital structure management without
requiring bondholder consent for each redemption.

## Governance proposals and voting

Execute shareholder voting with snapshot-based voting power, delegation
mechanics, and on-chain execution for approved proposals. The governance module
eliminates manual vote tallying and enforces quorum and approval thresholds
programmatically.

### Creating a governance proposal

As a shareholder holding the minimum proposal threshold (configurable percentage
of total supply), you can submit governance proposals. Navigate to **Asset
Management** &gt; **Equity** &gt; [Token Name] &gt; **Governance** &gt; **New
Proposal**.

Configure the proposal structure:

- **Title:** "Increase authorized share capital to 5 million shares"
- **Description:** Detailed rationale, board recommendation, shareholder impact
  analysis
- **Voting options:** For, Against, Abstain (or custom multi-choice options)
- **Voting period:** 7 days (duration proposal remains open)
- **Quorum:** 50% (minimum participation required for valid vote)
- **Approval threshold:** 66% (supermajority requirement for passage)
- **Executable action:** Optional on-chain transaction if proposal passes

Submit the proposal. The platform captures the current block height as the
snapshot block—voting power for all shareholders is determined by their token
balances at this exact block, preventing vote buying after proposal submission.

### Snapshot mechanics and voting power

When a proposal is created at block height 12,345,678, all voting power
calculations reference balances at that block. If a shareholder held 10,000
tokens at the snapshot block but sells 5,000 tokens the next day, they retain
10,000 voting power for this proposal.

This snapshot immutability prevents manipulation where shareholders acquire
tokens solely to vote, then immediately sell after voting. Traditional
shareholder meetings require record dates weeks in advance to produce physical
shareholder lists—the platform captures voting power atomically at proposal
creation with zero lead time.

Shareholders view their voting power in the governance panel:

- **Direct balance:** 10,000 tokens held at snapshot block
- **Delegated to address:** None
- **Delegated from others:** 5,000 tokens from 3 delegators
- **Total voting power:** 15,000 votes

### Vote delegation and proxy voting

Shareholders delegate voting power to other addresses (investment advisors,
board members, activist investors) without transferring token ownership.
Navigate to **Governance** &gt; **Delegate** and enter the delegate address.

The delegation applies to all future proposals until revoked. Delegators retain
token ownership and transfer rights—only governance voting power is delegated.
The delegate votes with combined direct holdings plus delegated power.

When the delegate votes on the "Increase authorized capital" proposal:

1. Select voting option: **For**
2. Confirm transaction
3. Platform records vote with timestamp and transaction hash
4. Vote cannot be changed (immutable after submission)
5. Voting power consumed: delegate's direct holdings + all delegated power

Delegation patterns enable institutional investors to consolidate voting power,
board members to represent retail shareholders, and decentralized governance
coordination.

### Tallying votes and executing proposals

After the 7-day voting period expires, review results in **Governance** &gt;
[Proposal Name]:

- **Total votes cast:** 750,000 (75% of 1,000,000 supply)
- **Quorum achieved:** Yes (required 50%, actual 75%)
- **For:** 495,000 votes (66%)
- **Against:** 255,000 votes (34%)
- **Abstain:** 0 votes
- **Approval threshold met:** Yes (required 66%, actual 66%)
- **Proposal status:** Passed

The proposal passed by exactly meeting the 66% supermajority threshold. If an
executable action was configured (e.g., call a smart contract function to
increase max supply), click **Execute Proposal** to trigger the on-chain
transaction.

Some governance configurations include execution delays (timelocks) where
approved proposals cannot execute immediately. This allows shareholders to exit
their positions if they disagree with the outcome before the change takes
effect—a common pattern in decentralized governance to prevent minority
shareholder exploitation.

<Callout type="default" title="For developers">
  See [Contract
  Reference](/docs/developer-guides/smart-contracts/contract-reference) for
  technical details on how voting power snapshots use ERC-20Votes extension with
  checkpoint-based balance tracking. The implementation enables zero-gas voting
  power queries for historical blocks without requiring full blockchain state
  reconstruction.
</Callout>

## Token splits and consolidations

Adjust token denomination without changing ownership percentages. Stock splits
increase share count and decrease per-share value proportionally; reverse splits
decrease share count and increase per-share value.

### Executing a stock split

Companies split shares to improve liquidity and accessibility when per-share
prices become high. A 2-for-1 split doubles share count and halves per-share
value.

Navigate to **Asset Management** &gt; **Equity** &gt; [Token Name] &gt;
**Actions** &gt; **Token Split** and configure:

- **Split numerator:** 2 (new shares per old share)
- **Split denominator:** 1 (old shares required)
- **Effective date:** May 1, 2025

Review the split impact:

- **Current total supply:** 1,000,000 shares at $50 per share
- **Post-split total supply:** 2,000,000 shares at $25 per share
- **Market cap:** $50 million (unchanged)

A shareholder holding 1,000 shares receives 2,000 shares after the split. Their
ownership percentage remains 0.1% of total supply (1,000 / 1,000,000 = 2,000 /
2,000,000).

Click **Execute Split** on the effective date. The platform:

1. Snapshots current holder balances
2. Mints additional tokens to each holder (balance × numerator / denominator)
3. Updates total supply (current supply × numerator / denominator)
4. Records split event with old supply, new supply, and split ratio

The split executes atomically—all shareholders receive their additional shares
simultaneously in a single transaction batch.

### Reverse splits and fractional handling

Reverse splits decrease share count to increase per-share value, often used when
stock prices fall too low. A 1-for-10 reverse split reduces share count by 90%
and increases per-share value 10×.

Configure the split with numerator 1 and denominator 10. A shareholder holding
1,000 shares receives 100 shares after the reverse split. Their ownership
percentage remains unchanged.

Reverse splits create fractional share challenges when shareholders hold amounts
not evenly divisible by the split denominator. A holder with 1,055 shares in a
1-for-10 reverse split should receive 105.5 shares, but blockchain tokens
typically use integer arithmetic.

The platform handles fractional shares by rounding down to the nearest whole
token and tracking fractional entitlements off-chain. Shareholders receive
either:

- Cash payment for fractional share value (if enabled)
- Fractional share certificate redeemable in future transactions
- Automatic rounding up to next whole share (issuer subsidizes fractional value)

Specify fractional handling in the split configuration to ensure consistent
treatment across all shareholders.

## Fund distributions and NAV adjustments

Distribute fund income, capital gains, or return of capital to unit holders.
Fund distributions follow the same snapshot and entitlement mechanics as equity
dividends but integrate with NAV (net asset value) updates.

### NAV-based income distributions

Investment funds distribute income periodically (quarterly, annually) based on
realized gains, dividend income, or interest earned. Navigate to **Asset
Management** &gt; **Funds** &gt; [Fund Name] &gt; **Distributions** &gt; **New
Distribution**.

Configure the distribution:

- **Distribution type:** Income, capital gains, or return of capital
- **Amount per unit:** $1.50 per fund share
- **Distribution token:** USDC
- **Ex-date:** June 1 (last day to own fund for distribution)
- **Record date:** June 3 (snapshot date)
- **Payment date:** June 15 (distribution date)

For a fund with 500,000 outstanding units paying $1.50 per unit:

```
Total distribution = 500,000 × $1.50 = $750,000 USDC
```

Fund the distribution wallet with $750,000 USDC before the payment date. Execute
the distribution using the same automated snapshot and settlement mechanics
described in the dividend section.

### NAV impact and accounting treatment

Fund distributions reduce NAV per unit by the distribution amount. If the fund's
pre-distribution NAV was $25.00 per unit, the post-distribution NAV adjusts to
$23.50 ($25.00 - $1.50).

The NAV adjustment reflects the economic reality that fund assets decreased by
the distributed amount. Total fund value decreases from $12.5 million (500,000
units × $25.00) to $11.75 million (500,000 units × $23.50), with the $750,000
difference distributed to unit holders.

Income distributions are taxable events for investors (dividend income,
short-term capital gains, or long-term capital gains depending on source).
Return of capital distributions reduce investor cost basis and may defer
taxation until unit redemption.

### Distribution reinvestment option

Enable automatic reinvestment where unit holders can elect to receive additional
fund shares instead of cash distributions. Configure the distribution with
**Reinvestment Enabled**.

Unit holders opt in to reinvestment through the dApp investor portal before the
ex-date. On the distribution date:

1. Calculate each holder's distribution amount
2. Opt-in holders: Mint new units at current NAV instead of USDC transfer
3. Opt-out holders: Transfer USDC distribution
4. Total fund units increase by reinvested amount

A holder entitled to a $1,500 distribution with post-distribution NAV of $23.50
receives 63.83 new fund units ($1,500 / $23.50). The fund does not transfer
USDC—it issues equity instead, simplifying operational cash management.

Reinvestment benefits unit holders through dollar-cost averaging (acquiring
additional units automatically) and benefits fund operators by reducing cash
outflows and maintaining AUM (assets under management).

## Observability and monitoring workflows

Integrate corporate action execution with the platform's observability stack to
verify funding status, distribution completion, and holder notifications.

### Distribution dashboard metrics

The **Corporate Actions** dashboard (navigate to **Analytics** &gt; **Corporate
Actions**) displays:

- **Upcoming actions:** Scheduled distributions, coupon payments, maturity dates
- **Funding status:** Vault balance vs. required amount for each pending action
- **Execution history:** Completed distributions with success rates, gas costs,
  transaction hashes
- **Failed payment remediation:** Holder addresses requiring compliance
  verification or wallet updates

Set up automated alerts for:

- **Underfunded vaults:** 48-hour pre-payment notification if vault balance
  insufficient
- **Distribution completion:** Notification when automated distribution executes
  successfully
- **Failed payment threshold:** Alert if &gt; 5% of holders experience payment
  failures
- **Upcoming deadlines:** 7-day advance notice for ex-dividend dates, record
  dates, payment dates

### Audit trail and compliance reporting

All corporate actions record immutable audit trails on-chain:

- Holder snapshots with block height references
- Entitlement calculations with per-holder amounts
- Distribution transactions with timestamps and gas costs
- Governance proposals with vote tallies and execution status

Export audit reports from **Analytics** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **Corporate
Actions**. The platform generates CSV or PDF reports suitable for regulatory
filings (8-K current reports, proxy statements, tax reporting).

The unified registry architecture ensures compliance verification occurs at
distribution time—holders without verified OnchainIDs or with transfer
restrictions automatically fail distribution attempts, preventing inadvertent
payments to non-compliant investors.

<Callout type="info" title="DALP differentiator">
  Traditional systems require fragmented compliance checks across custodians,
  transfer agents, and paying agents. The unified token registry enforces
  compliance atomically at settlement time—transfers only execute if all
  restrictions pass, eliminating post-facto remediation workflows.
</Callout>

## Best practices

**Communication and timing**

Announce corporate actions 30+ days in advance when possible. Provide clear
documentation explaining the action's purpose, shareholder impact, and key
dates. Send reminder notifications before ex-dividend dates and record dates.
Communicate distribution results within 24 hours of execution.

**Vault funding and reserves**

Fund distribution wallets 48-72 hours before payment dates to allow verification
time. Maintain 5-10% reserve buffers above calculated requirements to account
for rounding and late acquisitions. Monitor vault balances continuously through
the dashboard's funding status panel. Set up automated alerts for low balance
thresholds.

**Execution consistency**

Execute distributions on scheduled dates consistently to establish investor
confidence. Configure automated execution for recurring payments (quarterly
coupons, monthly fund distributions) to eliminate manual workflow dependencies.
Verify distributions complete successfully through the observability dashboard.
Investigate failed payments immediately—most indicate compliance issues
requiring identity verification updates.

**Record keeping and compliance**

Maintain immutable audit trails for all corporate actions through the platform's
on-chain recording. Archive shareholder snapshots for each action (required for
dispute resolution). Document board approvals and authorization workflows for
governance and regulatory compliance. Retain records per regulatory requirements
(typically 7 years for securities, longer for tax documentation).

**Regulatory coordination**

Ensure corporate actions receive proper board approval before execution. File
required regulatory disclosures (8-K current reports for material actions, proxy
statements for governance proposals, tax reporting for distributions).
Coordinate with legal counsel on disclosure requirements and shareholder
communication content. Verify compliance with transfer restrictions and
accreditation requirements before distributions.

## Troubleshooting

**Distribution execution fails with insufficient balance error**

Verify the distribution wallet holds the full required amount plus 5-10% buffer.
Check the **Funding Status** panel in the distribution details—it displays
required amount vs. current vault balance. Transfer additional denomination
assets to the vault address and retry execution. Set up funding status alerts to
prevent recurrence.

**Holders report not receiving distributions**

Confirm holder addresses have verified OnchainIDs in the identity registry.
Navigate to **Identity Management** &gt; search holder address &gt; verify
claims are up to date. Check transfer restriction rules—some compliance
configurations prevent distributions to addresses with expired accreditation.
Review the **Failed Payments** section in distribution results for affected
addresses and remediation steps.

**Governance proposal creation reverts with threshold error**

Verify your address holds the minimum proposal creation threshold at current
block height. The threshold is typically 1-5% of total supply to prevent spam
proposals. Check that voting is enabled on your equity token—navigate to **Token
Settings** &gt; **Governance** &gt; confirm **Voting Enabled** is true. Ensure
quorum and approval threshold percentages are valid (between 0-100%).

**Vote transaction fails with no voting power error**

Confirm you held tokens at the proposal creation block (snapshot block). Voting
power is determined by balance at snapshot time, not current balance. If you
acquired tokens after the proposal was submitted, you cannot vote on that
specific proposal. Check your voting power in the proposal details panel—it
displays your balance at the snapshot block.

**Bond redemption function disabled after maturity**

Verify the bond's maturity date has passed by checking **Maturity Date** in bond
details. Ensure the bond status is set to **Matured**—navigate to **Actions**
&gt; **Mature Bond** and click to activate redemption if needed. Confirm the
redemption vault is funded with sufficient denomination assets (outstanding
bonds × face value). Check that your wallet holds bond tokens to redeem.

**Coupon payment executes with zero amounts**

Verify the yield schedule is configured correctly with annual rate, payment
frequency, and denomination token. Navigate to **Yield** &gt; **Schedule
Configuration** to review parameters. Check that the yield wallet holds
sufficient denomination assets for the calculated payment. Confirm bondholders

addresses. Review accrual calculations in the **Yield** tab to ensure daily
accrual is tracking correctly.
