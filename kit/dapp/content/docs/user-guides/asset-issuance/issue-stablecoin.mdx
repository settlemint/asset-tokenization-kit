Stablecoin tokens represent fiat-backed digital currencies with collateral
reserves, peg maintenance mechanisms, and regulated issuance/redemption
workflows. This guide walks you through deploying compliant stablecoins from
configuration through operational reserve management.

**Who should read this:** Financial institutions, payment service providers,
money transmitters, and digital currency issuers creating fiat-backed
stablecoins.

**Time required:** 20-25 minutes for stablecoin deployment; additional time for
reserve and collateral configuration.

**Prerequisites:**

- Completed [Getting started](/docs/user-guides/onboarding/getting-started)
  onboarding
- Stablecoin system factory deployed during onboarding
- Banking relationships established for fiat reserves
- Regulatory framework determined (e-money license, money transmitter license,
  or equivalent)
- Reserve attestation process configured

<Steps>

<Step>

## Step 1: Navigate to stablecoin creation

From the main dashboard:

1. Click **Asset Management** in the left sidebar
2. Select **Stablecoins** from the asset type list
3. Click **Create New Stablecoin** button

![Stablecoin creation navigation](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Asset Management section showing Stablecoins category with existing
stablecoins list and Create New Stablecoin button_

</Step>

<Step>

## Step 2: Configure stablecoin parameters

### Basic token information

Enter standard token details:

- **Token name** - Full legal name (e.g., "Platform USD Stablecoin")
- **Token symbol** - Trading symbol (e.g., "PUSD")
- **Decimals** - Token divisibility (6 for USDC-style, 18 for DAI-style)
- **Initial supply** - Number of tokens to mint at deployment (typically 0 for
  stablecoins)

![Stablecoin basic information](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Stablecoin configuration form showing name, symbol, decimals, and
initial supply fields with validation_

**Naming guidance:** Include currency designation (USD, EUR, GBP) in symbol for
clear peg identification.

**Decimals consideration:** Most USD stablecoins use 6 decimals matching
traditional finance cent precision; 18 decimals provides DeFi compatibility.

### Stablecoin-specific parameters

Configure peg and collateral properties:

**Peg currency**

Select fiat currency:

- **USD** - US Dollar (most common)
- **EUR** - Euro
- **GBP** - British Pound
- **JPY** - Japanese Yen
- **Custom** - Other fiat currencies

**Peg ratio**

Define token-to-fiat relationship:

- **1:1 peg** - Standard stablecoin (1 token = 1 fiat unit)
- **Custom ratio** - Non-standard peg (e.g., 1 token = 100 fiat units)

**Collateralization model**

The platform requires full collateralization:

- **Fully reserved (required)** - 100% fiat backing (1:1 reserve ratio)
- **Overcollateralized (optional)** - >100% reserves for added security margin

![Peg and collateral configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Stablecoin parameters showing peg currency dropdown, peg ratio
input, and collateralization ratio input (minimum 100%)_

**Regulatory requirement:** E-money regulations require 100% or
overcollateralized reserves. The platform does not support fractional reserve
stablecoins.

### Reserve management

Configure collateral tracking:

**Reserve wallet**

Specify on-chain reserve address:

- Enter wallet address holding collateral tokens
- Platform tracks reserve balance for transparency
- Multiple reserve wallets supported for diversification

**Collateral composition**

Define accepted reserve assets:

- **Fiat-backed tokens** - USDC, USDT for USD stablecoins
- **Bank deposits** - Off-chain fiat (requires attestation)
- **Money market instruments** - Short-term treasuries (requires valuation)
- **Mixed reserves** - Combination of on-chain and off-chain collateral

For each collateral type, configure:

- Asset address (for on-chain collateral)
- Haircut percentage (discount factor for risk)
- Maximum allocation percentage

![Reserve configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Reserve management showing reserve wallet address field and collateral assets
table with asset, allocation, haircut, and maximum percentage columns_

</Step>

<Step>

## Step 3: Configure issuance and redemption

Stablecoins require regulated mint/burn workflows for peg maintenance.

### Issuance (minting) settings

Define how new stablecoins are created:

**Issuance process**

- **Permissioned issuance** - Only authorized issuers can mint
- **Proof of reserve required** - Mint only after collateral deposit verified
- **Minimum issuance** - Minimum mint amount (e.g., $10,000 equivalent)
- **Issuance fee** - Basis point fee on minting (typically 0-10 bps)

**Authorized issuers**

Add addresses permitted to mint:

1. Click **Add Issuer**
2. Enter issuer address
3. Set issuance limits:
   - Daily mint cap
   - Single transaction maximum
4. Assign issuer role

Only authorized issuers with SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE can mint tokens.

![Issuance configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Issuance settings showing permissioned toggle, minimum amount input, fee input,
and authorized issuers list with addresses and limits_

### Redemption (burning) settings

Configure how stablecoins are redeemed for fiat:

**Redemption process**

- **Redemption enabled** - Toggle to allow/disallow redemptions
- **Minimum redemption** - Minimum burn amount
- **Redemption fee** - Basis point fee on redemptions
- **Settlement time** - T+0, T+1, T+2 settlement for fiat payouts
- **Business hours only** - Restrict redemptions to business days/hours

**Redemption limits**

Set withdrawal constraints:

- **Daily redemption cap** - Maximum daily redemption volume
- **Per-address redemption limit** - Maximum redemption per user per period
- **Reserve threshold** - Pause redemptions if reserves drop below percentage

![Redemption configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Redemption settings showing enabled toggle, minimum/fee inputs, settlement time
selector, and limit configuration fields_

**Circuit breaker:** Configure automatic redemption pause if reserve ratio drops
below threshold (e.g., 95%).

</Step>

<Step>

## Step 4: Set compliance rules

Stablecoin tokens enforce e-money regulations and AML requirements.

### Regulatory framework selection

Choose applicable regulatory framework:

- **E-Money Directive (EMD2)** - EU electronic money
- **MiCA** - Markets in Crypto-Assets (EU)
- **Money Transmitter License** - US state-by-state licensing
- **Payment Services Directive (PSD2)** - EU payment services
- **Custom** - Jurisdiction-specific compliance

The platform pre-configures compliance modules for selected framework.

![Compliance framework selection](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Regulatory framework cards showing EMD2, MiCA, MTL, PSD2, and
Custom options with regulatory requirement summaries_

### Configure compliance modules

Based on selected framework, configure modules:

**Identity verification**

Set OnchainID claim requirements:

- **KYC/AML verification** - Level 1 (basic) or Level 2 (enhanced)
- **Jurisdiction verification** - Country of residence confirmed
- **Sanctions screening** - Not on OFAC/EU sanctions lists
- **PEP screening** - Politically exposed persons status
- **Business verification** - For institutional holders

All stablecoin holders must have verified OnchainIDs with required claims.

**Transfer restrictions**

Configure transaction monitoring:

- **Transaction limits** - Maximum transfer amount per transaction
- **Velocity limits** - Maximum volume per address per time period
- **Blocklist** - Sanctioned addresses cannot hold or transfer
- **Country restrictions** - Geographic limitations on holders

![Compliance module configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Compliance modules showing Identity Verification requirements,
Transfer Restrictions, Transaction Limits, and Blocklist management panels_

**AML requirement:** Configure transaction monitoring thresholds per regulatory
requirements (e.g., $10,000 reporting threshold).

### Transparency and attestation

Configure public reporting:

**Reserve attestation**

Set up periodic reserve verification:

- **Attestation frequency** - Daily, weekly, or monthly attestations
- **Attestor** - Independent auditor or attestation service
- **Publication method** - On-chain hash commitment or off-chain reporting
- **Proof of reserves** - Cryptographic proof mechanism (optional)

**Public transparency**

Enable public data feeds:

- **Total supply** - Publicly visible circulating supply
- **Reserve balance** - Real-time reserve tracking
- **Collateralization ratio** - Current backing percentage
- **Redemption statistics** - Aggregate redemption metrics

![Attestation configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Attestation settings showing frequency selector, attestor address input,
publication method options, and transparency toggles_

</Step>

<Step>

## Step 5: Assign operational roles

Grant permissions for stablecoin management:

### Role assignments

Assign addresses to stablecoin-specific roles:

**GOVERNANCE_ROLE**

Manages stablecoin policies:

- Configure compliance modules
- Update reserve requirements
- Manage attestation schedule
- Pause/unpause issuance and redemptions

Typically assigned to: Compliance officer or regulatory affairs wallet

**SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE**

Controls token supply:

- Mint new stablecoins (proof of reserve required)
- Burn stablecoins (process redemptions)
- Manage authorized issuer list

Typically assigned to: Treasury operations wallet

**CUSTODIAN_ROLE**

Handles AML enforcement:

- Freeze sanctioned accounts
- Execute forced transfers (court/regulatory orders)
- Recover lost tokens
- Manage blocklist

Typically assigned to: AML compliance wallet

**EMERGENCY_ROLE**

Emergency interventions:

- Pause all transfers
- Pause issuance/redemptions

   - Reserve tracking enabled
   - Roles assigned correctly

![Stablecoin details overview](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Stablecoin token details page showing key metrics, total supply, reserve
balance, collateralization ratio, and peg status_

### Fund reserve wallet

Establish initial collateral:

1. Transfer collateral to reserve wallet address:
   - Fiat-backed stablecoins (USDC, USDT, etc.)
   - Or coordinate fiat deposit to linked bank account
2. Verify reserve balance appears on **Reserves** tab
3. Confirm collateralization ratio shows 100%+ before first mint

**Best practice:** Maintain 105-110% collateralization buffer for operational
flexibility.

### Configure reserve attestation

Set up independent verification:

**For automated attestation:**

1. Navigate to **Attestation** tab
2. Click **Configure Attestor**
3. Enter attestor service address or API endpoint
4. Set attestation frequency
5. Test attestation connection
6. Enable automated attestations

**For manual attestation:**

1. Contract independent auditor or accountant
2. Provide reserve wallet addresses and bank account information
3. Schedule periodic attestation reports
4. Post attestation hashes on-chain via **Attestation** &gt; **Post Report**

![Attestation setup](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Attestation configuration showing attestor service connection, frequency
settings, and manual report upload interface_

### Enable issuance

Activate stablecoin minting:

1. Navigate to **Settings** tab
2. Toggle **Issuance Enabled** to on
3. Confirm reserve wallet funded
4. Review authorized issuer list
5. Save changes

Authorized issuers can now mint stablecoins against reserves.

</Step>

<Step>

## Step 8: Operate stablecoin lifecycle

### Process issuance requests

Mint new stablecoins:

**Issuance workflow:**

1. Receive fiat deposit or collateral transfer:
   - Customer wires fiat to issuer bank account
   - Or customer transfers USDC/USDT to reserve wallet
2. Verify deposit cleared and available
3. Navigate to **Actions** &gt; **Mint Stablecoins**
4. Enter:
   - Recipient address (verified OnchainID required)
   - Mint amount
   - Collateral reference (transaction hash or wire reference)
5. Review collateralization ratio after mint
6. Click **Execute Mint**

**Validation checks:**

- Recipient has verified OnchainID with required claims
- Reserve balance sufficient for mint (maintains collateralization ratio)
- Mint amount within issuer's daily limit
- Recipient not on blocklist

![Issuance interface](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Mint
stablecoins form showing recipient address input, amount field, collateral
reference, pre/post collateralization ratios, and execute button_

**Proof of reserve:** Platform records collateral reference on-chain, linking
each mint to specific reserve deposit.

### Process redemption requests

Burn stablecoins and return fiat:

**Redemption workflow:**

1. Customer submits redemption request via dApp:
   - Enters redemption amount
   - Selects payout method (wire transfer or stablecoin)
   - Provides banking details (for fiat redemptions)
2. Request appears in **Redemptions** &gt; **Pending** queue
3. Navigate to **Redemptions** tab
4. Review request details:
   - Customer identity and KYC status
   - Redemption amount
   - Payout method
   - Settlement date
5. Process redemption:
   - Click **Process Redemption**
   - Platform burns tokens from customer address
   - Initiate fiat wire or transfer collateral stablecoin
   - Mark redemption as complete

**Settlement:**

- T+0: Same-day settlement (stablecoin collateral payout)
- T+1: Next business day (wire transfer)
- T+2: Two business day (international wire)

![Redemption queue](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Redemption
requests table showing pending requests with customer, amount, payout method,
settlement date, and process button_

**Collateralization maintenance:** Reserve balance decreases proportionally with
redemptions; monitor ratio stays above minimum.

### Monitor collateralization ratio

Track reserve health:

1. Navigate to **Reserves** tab
2. Review key metrics:
   - Total supply (circulating stablecoins)
   - Reserve balance (on-chain and off-chain collateral)
   - Collateralization ratio percentage
   - Excess reserves amount
   - Reserve composition breakdown
3. Monitor alerts:
   - Yellow alert: Ratio drops below 102%
   - Red alert: Ratio drops below 100%
   - Circuit breaker: Ratio drops below configured threshold (e.g., 95%)

**Collateralization formula:** (Reserve Balance / Total Supply) × 100%

![Reserve dashboard](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Reserves
tab showing collateralization ratio gauge, reserve balance chart, composition
pie chart, and historical ratio trend line_

### Maintain price peg

Monitor and manage peg stability:

**Peg monitoring:**

1. Navigate to **Peg Health** tab
2. Review peg metrics:
   - Current market price (from DEX oracles)
   - Target peg price (1.00 USD)
   - Deviation percentage
   - Trading volume across DEXs
3. Monitor peg history chart for trends

**Peg maintenance actions:**

**If trading above peg (e.g., $1.02):**

- Increase issuance to expand supply
- Signal willingness to mint at par
- Provide DEX liquidity

**If trading below peg (e.g., $0.98):**

- Increase redemption accessibility
- Buy back tokens from market
- Signal redemption availability

![Peg health dashboard](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Peg
health showing current price, target price, deviation gauge, price history
chart, and recommended actions panel_

**Arbitrage mechanism:** Price deviations create arbitrage opportunities that
naturally restore peg through redemption/issuance activity.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Common workflows

### Handle reserve rebalancing

Adjust collateral composition:

1. Navigate to **Reserves** &gt; **Rebalance**
2. Review current allocation vs. target allocation
3. Configure rebalancing:
   - Reduce asset: Transfer excess from reserve wallet
   - Increase asset: Transfer to reserve wallet
4. Execute rebalancing transactions
5. Verify new allocation percentages

**Example:** Reduce USDT from 60% to 50%, increase USDC from 40% to 50%.

### Implement circuit breaker

Pause operations during stress:

1. Monitor collateralization ratio and market conditions
2. If ratio drops below threshold or market anomaly detected:
   - Navigate to **Emergency** &gt; **Circuit Breaker**
   - Click **Activate**
3. Circuit breaker actions:
   - Pauses all issuance
   - Pauses all redemptions
   - Allows existing transfers to continue
4. Investigate cause and restore reserves
5. Navigate to **Emergency** &gt; **Deactivate Circuit Breaker**

Requires EMERGENCY_ROLE permission.

### Handle sanctioned address

Freeze and recover from prohibited wallet:

1. Identify sanctioned address (OFAC, EU, etc.)
2. Navigate to **Compliance** &gt; **Blocklist**
3. Click **Add Address**
4. Enter address and sanction reason
5. Click **Freeze and Blocklist**
6. Platform:
   - Prevents future transfers to/from address
   - Optionally freezes current balance
7. If required, use **Forced Transfer** to move tokens to segregated wallet

Requires CUSTODIAN_ROLE permission.

### Increase redemption limits

Adjust withdrawal caps:

1. Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Redemptions**
2. Click **Edit Limits**
3. Modify parameters:
   - Daily redemption cap
   - Per-address limit
   - Settlement time
4. Requires GOVERNANCE_ROLE approval
5. Save changes

**Use case:** Increase limits during market volatility to maintain confidence in
redemption access.

## Best practices

**Before deployment:**

- Obtain all required money transmitter or e-money licenses
- Establish banking relationships with multiple institutions
- Set up independent attestation service
- Prepare AML/KYC procedures and screening tools
- Test issuance/redemption workflows in staging environment

**During operations:**

- Maintain collateralization ratio above 105% continuously
- Execute attestations on consistent schedule (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Monitor peg health multiple times daily
- Reconcile on-chain and off-chain reserves daily
- Review blocklist against updated sanctions lists weekly
- Maintain operational runway in reserves for redemption capacity

**Reserve management:**

- Diversify reserve holdings across multiple stablecoins and banks
- Maintain liquidity buffer of 10-20% of supply for redemptions
- Use reserve management policy with asset allocation limits
- Conduct stress testing for redemption scenarios
- Have backup liquidity sources (credit lines) for crisis scenarios

**Compliance:**

- Implement real-time transaction monitoring
- Screen all new holders against sanctions lists
- Maintain comprehensive audit trail of all mints/burns
- File suspicious activity reports (SARs) per AML requirements
- Update compliance modules for regulatory changes

## Troubleshooting

**Deployment fails with "Invalid collateralization ratio"**

- Verify ratio is 100% or higher
- Check ratio is reasonable (typically 100-200%)
- Ensure ratio format is correct (e.g., 100 for 100%, not 1.0)

**Issuance reverts with "Insufficient reserves"**

- Check reserve wallet has adequate collateral balance
- Verify mint amount would not drop ratio below minimum
- Ensure collateral tokens are approved for platform use
- Confirm reserve wallet address is correctly configured

**Redemption processing fails**

- Verify issuer's payout wallet has sufficient fiat tokens
- Check redemption amount within daily limit
- Ensure customer holds sufficient stablecoin balance
- Confirm settlement date is valid business day

**Collateralization ratio showing incorrect value**

- Refresh reserve balance (may have sync delay)
- Verify off-chain reserve attestation is current
- Check for pending mints/burns affecting calculation
- Ensure reserve wallet addresses are all configured

**Peg deviating significantly from target**

- Review redemption accessibility (ensure not paused)
- Check issuance capacity (sufficient reserves for mints)
- Monitor DEX liquidity depth
- Verify arbitrage opportunities are accessible
- Consider market-making operations to stabilize
