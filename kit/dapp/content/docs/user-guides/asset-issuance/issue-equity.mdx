## Before you start

**Prerequisites:**

- Completed [Getting started](/docs/user-guides/onboarding/getting-started)
  onboarding
- Equity system factory deployed during onboarding
- Shareholder agreement and cap table prepared
- Regulatory framework determined (Reg D, Reg S, Reg A, or custom)

**Time estimate:** 15-20 minutes for equity deployment; additional time for
governance configuration

**Required knowledge:**

- Basic blockchain wallet operations
- Understanding of equity instruments and cap table management
- Familiarity with securities regulations
- Corporate governance basics (if enabling voting)

## Steps

### 1. Navigate to equity creation

From your dashboard:

1. Click **Asset Management** in the left sidebar
2. Select **Equity** from the asset type list
3. Click **Create New Equity Token**

![Equity creation navigation](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Asset Management section showing Equity category with existing equity tokens
list and Create New Equity Token button_

### 2. Configure token parameters

#### Basic token information

Enter your token details:

- **Token name** - Full legal name (e.g., "TechStartup Inc. Series A Preferred")
- **Token symbol** - Trading symbol (e.g., "TECH-A")
- **Decimals** - Token divisibility (0 for whole shares, 18 for fractional
  ownership)
- **Initial supply** - Number of shares to mint at deployment (or 0 to mint
  later)

![Equity basic information](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Equity configuration form showing name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply
fields with validation_

**Naming tip:** Include share class (Common, Preferred, Series A/B/C) in the
name for cap table clarity.

#### Share class configuration

Define your equity class properties:

**Share class type**

Select class:

- **Common Stock** - Standard ownership shares with voting rights
- **Preferred Stock** - Priority shares with special rights
- **Fund Units** - Investment fund ownership interests

**Voting rights**

Configure governance participation:

1. **Enable voting** - Toggle voting capabilities on/off
2. **Voting weight** - Set votes per share (typically 1:1)
3. **Quorum requirements** - Minimum participation for valid votes (optional)

![Share class configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Share class settings showing class type dropdown, voting toggle, and voting
weight input_

**Common vs. Preferred:** Common stock typically has voting rights; preferred
stock may have none or limited votes but includes liquidation preferences.

#### Cap table integration

Link to your existing cap table:

- **Total authorized shares** - Maximum issuable shares (sets supply cap)
- **Par value** - Nominal value per share (if applicable)
- **Valuation reference** - Latest company valuation (for NAV tracking)

The contract uses this data to enforce cap table limits and calculate ownership
percentages.

### 3. Configure compliance framework

Your equity token enforces transfer restrictions based on securities laws.

#### Regulatory framework selection

Choose your applicable regulatory framework:

- **Regulation D (506b/506c)** - US private placement (accredited investors)
- **Regulation S** - Offshore offering (non-US investors)
- **Regulation A+** - Mini-IPO (broader investor base with disclosure)
- **Regulation CF** - Crowdfunding (small investors, investment limits)
- **Custom** - Define custom compliance for non-US jurisdictions

![Compliance framework selection](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Regulatory framework cards showing Reg D, Reg S, Reg A+, Reg CF,
and Custom options with descriptions and investor limits_

#### Configure compliance modules

Based on your selected framework, configure these modules:

**Investor eligibility**

Set OnchainID claim requirements:

- **Accredited investor** status (required for Reg D 506c)
- **Qualified purchaser** status (for certain funds)
- **Income/net worth verification** (for crowdfunding limits)
- **KYC/AML verification** level

**Transfer restrictions**

Configure share transfer rules:

- **Right of first refusal (ROFR)** - Company approval required for secondary
  transfers
- **Lock-up period** - Restrict sales for vesting schedule (e.g., 12-month
  cliff)
- **Shareholder approval** - Require board consent for transfers above threshold
- **Maximum holders limit** - Cap total shareholder count (e.g., 499 for
  avoiding SEC registration)

![Compliance modules configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Compliance modules showing Investor Eligibility, Transfer
Restrictions, and Lock-up Period panels with configuration options_

**Reg D special considerations:** 506(b) allows up to 35 non-accredited
investors; 506(c) requires all investors be accredited with verification.

#### Geographic restrictions

Limit share ownership by jurisdiction:

1. Enable **Country Allow List** module
2. Select permitted countries
3. Or enable **Country Block List** for restricted jurisdictions

**Note:** Regulation S typically excludes US investors; Regulation D restricts
to US only.

### 4. Set up governance (optional)

If you enabled voting, configure on-chain voting for shareholder decisions.

**Note:** Governance features require the voting add-on. You must enable it
during equity token creation.

#### Governance parameters

Define your voting mechanics:

**Voting power calculation**

- **One token = one vote** - Standard democratic voting
- **Weighted voting** - Different classes have different vote multipliers
- **Snapshot-based** - Voting power determined by holdings at proposal creation

The platform uses ERC20Votes standard for checkpoint-based voting power
tracking.

**Proposal settings**

Configure proposal lifecycle:

- **Proposal threshold** - Minimum tokens required to create proposal
- **Voting period** - Duration proposals remain open (e.g., 7 days)
- **Execution delay** - Timelock before approved proposals execute
- **Quorum** - Minimum participation required for validity

![Governance configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Governance settings showing voting power model, proposal threshold, voting
period, and quorum inputs_

**Best practice:** Set quorum at 20-40% of outstanding shares to balance
engagement with practical governance.

#### Delegation support

Enable vote delegation:

1. Toggle **Allow delegation** on
2. Your shareholders can delegate voting power to representatives
3. Delegation is recorded on-chain with vote checkpoints
4. Delegates vote with combined power

**Use case:** Shareholder representatives or proxy voting services.

### 5. Assign operational roles

Grant permissions for equity management.

#### Role assignments

Assign wallet addresses to these equity-specific roles:

**GOVERNANCE_ROLE**

Manages compliance and corporate governance:

- Configure compliance modules
- Manage shareholder eligibility
- Create governance proposals
- Update share class parameters

Typically assigned to: Corporate secretary or board representative wallet

**SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE**

Controls share issuance and buybacks:

- Mint new shares (authorized issuance)
- Burn shares (buybacks, cancellations)
- Batch operations for cap table updates

Typically assigned to: CFO or treasury wallet

**CUSTODIAN_ROLE**

Handles shareholder account operations:

- Freeze compromised accounts
- Execute forced transfers (court orders)
- Recover lost shares

Typically assigned to: Transfer agent wallet

**EMERGENCY_ROLE**

Emergency interventions:

- Pause all transfers
- Unpause after incident resolution

Typically assigned to: Security operations wallet

![Role assignment interface](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Role assignment form showing four roles with address inputs, role descriptions,
and permission lists_

**Separation of duties:** Use different multisig wallets for each role to
prevent single-point-of-failure.

### 6. Review and deploy

#### Pre-deployment checklist

Verify your configuration:

- [ ] Token name and symbol match cap table
- [ ] Share class type correct (Common/Preferred)

and shareholder distribution_

#### Issue initial allocation

If you deployed with zero initial supply:

1. Prepare your founder and investor allocations
2. Navigate to the **Actions** tab
3. Click **Mint Shares**
4. Enter recipient addresses and amounts
5. Click **Execute Batch Mint**

**Vesting setup:** For shares with vesting schedules, mint to vesting contract
addresses rather than directly to shareholders.

#### Configure vesting schedules (optional)

For founder or employee shares with vesting:

1. Navigate to **Addons** section
2. Deploy **Vesting Airdrop** addon for each vesting schedule
3. Configure:
   - Vesting start date
   - Cliff period (e.g., 12 months)
   - Vesting duration (e.g., 48 months total)
   - Linear vs. milestone vesting
4. Mint shares to vesting contract
5. Add beneficiaries with allocation amounts

Shares release according to vesting schedule automatically.

### 8. Manage shareholder operations

#### Track cap table

Monitor your ownership structure:

1. Navigate to **Shareholders** tab
2. Review current holders:
   - Address and identity
   - Share count
   - Ownership percentage
   - Voting power
   - Acquisition date
3. Export cap table as CSV for reporting

![Shareholder cap table](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Shareholders tab showing table with columns for address, identity, shares held,
percentage, voting power, and acquisition date_

**Real-time accuracy:** Your cap table updates instantly with each transfer; no
reconciliation delays.

#### Process share transfers

Handle secondary transfers with your approval workflow:

**For transfers requiring approval:**

1. Shareholder initiates transfer via dApp
2. Transfer enters pending state
3. Navigate to **Pending Transfers** section
4. Review transfer details:
   - Sender and recipient
   - Share amount
   - Compliance status
   - ROFR implications
5. Click **Approve** or **Reject** with reason

**Compliance automation:** The contract auto-rejects transfers where the
recipient lacks required claims or violates transfer restrictions.

#### Create governance proposals

For equity with voting enabled:

**Create new proposal:**

1. Navigate to **Governance** tab
2. Click **New Proposal**
3. Enter proposal details:
   - Title and description
   - Proposed action (informational or on-chain execution)
   - Voting options (For/Against/Abstain)
   - Voting period
4. Click **Submit Proposal**

**Threshold check:** Your address must hold minimum proposal threshold in
shares.

**Cast votes:**

Shareholders vote on proposals:

1. Navigate to **Governance** &gt; **Active Proposals**
2. Review proposal details
3. Click **Vote**
4. Select option (For/Against/Abstain)
5. Optionally delegate votes
6. Confirm vote transaction

**Note:** Voting power is determined by shares held at proposal creation
(checkpoint).

![Governance voting interface](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Governance tab showing active proposal with title, description, voting options,
current tally, and vote button_

#### Execute dividend distributions

Distribute profits to your shareholders:

**For equity with yield addon:**

1. Navigate to **Dividends** tab
2. Click **Schedule Distribution**
3. Configure:
   - Distribution token (USDC, USDT, etc.)
   - Amount per share
   - Payment date
   - Snapshot date (holder eligibility)
4. Fund dividend wallet with total distribution amount
5. Execute distribution on payment date

Distribution happens proportionally based on snapshot holdings.

**Without yield add-on:**

Use manual batch transfer or deploy a dividend distribution contract.

**Note:** An automated dividend dashboard is planned for a future release.

### Common workflows

**Handle new investor onboarding:**

Add a new shareholder:

1. Investor completes KYC through platform or integrated provider
2. Investor's OnchainID receives required claims
3. Verify investor appears in **Eligible Investors** list
4. Navigate to **Actions** &gt; **Mint Shares**
5. Enter investor address and allocation
6. Execute mint (compliance checks run automatically)

**Process employee share options exercise:**

Convert options to shares:

1. Employee exercises options (off-chain or via options contract)
2. Navigate to **Actions** &gt; **Mint Shares**
3. Enter employee address and exercised share count
4. Optionally attach to vesting schedule
5. Execute mint

**Execute buyback program:**

Repurchase shares from shareholders:

1. Obtain shareholder consent for buyback
2. Transfer buyback funds to company treasury
3. Initiate share transfer from shareholder to company wallet
4. Navigate to **Actions** &gt; **Burn Shares**
5. Enter company wallet address and amount to burn
6. Execute burn (reduces total supply)

Record buyback in corporate resolutions.

**Update shareholder eligibility:**

Modify compliance requirements:

1. Navigate to **Compliance** tab
2. Select module to update (e.g., Country Allow List)
3. Modify parameters (add/remove countries, change claim requirements)
4. Click **Update Module**
5. Requires GOVERNANCE_ROLE

**Impact:** Existing holders are grandfathered; new requirements apply to future
transfers only.

## Results

After completing these steps, you will have:

- A deployed equity token contract with your specified share class parameters
- Configured compliance rules matching your regulatory framework
- (Optional) On-chain governance enabled with voting and proposal mechanisms
- Assigned operational roles to designated wallet addresses
- Issued initial share allocations to verified investors
- (Optional) Configured vesting schedules for founder and employee shares

Your equity token is now live with an on-chain cap table that updates in
real-time. Shareholders can transfer shares subject to your compliance rules,
and participate in governance if you enabled voting.

## Troubleshooting

**Deployment fails with "Total supply exceeds authorized shares":**

- Verify your initial supply is less than the authorized shares cap
- Check your cap configuration includes adequate buffer for future issuance

**Minting fails for investor:**

- Verify the investor's OnchainID is registered
- Check the investor has all required claims (accredited status, jurisdiction,
  KYC level)
- Confirm the investor's country is not on your blocklist
- Ensure total supply after mint does not exceed the cap

**Governance proposal creation fails:**

- Verify your address holds the minimum proposal threshold
- Check voting is enabled in your equity configuration
- Ensure proposal parameters are within allowed ranges
- Confirm you enabled the voting add-on during deployment

**Vote transaction reverts:**

- Confirm you hold shares at the proposal creation checkpoint
- Verify the proposal is still in the voting period (not ended or executed)
- Check you haven't already voted on this proposal

**Dividend distribution fails:**

- Verify your dividend wallet has sufficient distribution token balance
- Check the calculation: (total supply × amount per share) = required balance
- Ensure all eligible holders have verified OnchainIDs

**Voting add-on not available after deployment:**

- The voting module must be enabled during equity token creation
- You cannot add voting to existing equity tokens
- Redeploy with the voting add-on enabled if governance features are required
