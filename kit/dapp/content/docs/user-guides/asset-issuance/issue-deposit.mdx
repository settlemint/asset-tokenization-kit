Deposit tokens represent digital certificates of deposit with fixed terms,
interest rates, and maturity-based redemption. This guide walks you through
deploying compliant deposit tokens from configuration through maturity
processing.

**Who should read this:** Banks, credit unions, financial institutions, and
deposit-taking entities issuing tokenized certificates of deposit (CDs) or time
deposits.

**Time required:** 15-20 minutes for deposit deployment; additional time for
interest configuration.

**Prerequisites:**

- Completed [Getting started](/docs/user-guides/getting-started) onboarding
- Deposit system factory deployed during onboarding
- Denomination asset (payment token) deployed or address available
- Deposit terms defined (term length, interest rate, early withdrawal penalties)
- Banking license or deposit-taking authorization

## Step 1: Navigate to deposit creation

From the main dashboard:

1. Click **Asset Management** in the left sidebar
2. Select **Deposits** from the asset type list
3. Click **Create New Deposit Token** button

![Deposit creation navigation](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Asset Management section showing Deposits category with existing deposit
products list and Create New Deposit Token button_

## Step 2: Configure deposit parameters

### Basic token information

Enter standard token details:

- **Token name** - Full legal name (e.g., "FirstBank 12-Month CD January 2026")
- **Token symbol** - Trading symbol (e.g., "FB12M-JAN26")
- **Decimals** - Token divisibility (0 for whole certificates, 18 for fractional
  deposits)
- **Initial supply** - Number of tokens to mint at deployment (typically 0 for
  deposits)

![Deposit basic information](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Deposit configuration form showing name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply
fields with validation_

**Naming guidance:** Include term length and maturity period in name for clear
identification of deposit product.

### Deposit-specific parameters

Configure certificate of deposit properties:

**Term length**

Set deposit duration:

- **Fixed term** - Specify exact term length (e.g., 3 months, 6 months, 12
  months, 24 months)
- **Maturity date** - Calculated automatically: issue date + term length
- **Business day adjustment** - Adjust maturity to business day if falls on
  weekend/holiday

Common CD terms: 3-month, 6-month, 12-month, 24-month, 36-month, 60-month

**Interest rate**

Define deposit yield:

- **Annual percentage rate (APR)** - Nominal interest rate (entered as basis
  points)
- **Compounding frequency** - Simple, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual
- **Interest payment method** - At maturity or periodic distribution

![Deposit term configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Deposit parameters showing term length input, maturity date (auto-calculated),
APR input with basis points converter, and compounding frequency dropdown_

**Interest rate examples:**

- 2.5% APR = 250 basis points
- 4.0% APR = 400 basis points
- 5.5% APR = 550 basis points

**Denomination asset**

Specify the underlying deposit currency:

- Enter the ERC20 contract address for the deposit token
- Common choices: USDC, USDT, or institutional stablecoin
- Must be deployed ERC20 contract with decimals() function
- Validates address format and checks contract exists

**Example configuration:**

- Term: 12 months
- APR: 4.0% (400 bps)
- Denomination: USDC
- Result: Depositors receive 4% annual interest paid in USDC

### Early withdrawal configuration

Set penalties for pre-maturity redemption:

**Early withdrawal penalty**

- **Penalty type** - Fixed fee, interest forfeiture, or percentage of principal
- **Penalty amount** - Fee in basis points or fixed amount
- **Grace period** - Days after issuance allowing penalty-free withdrawal
  (optional)

**Early withdrawal options**

- **Allowed** - Depositors can withdraw early with penalty
- **Restricted** - Early withdrawal only in specific circumstances
- **Prohibited** - No early withdrawal until maturity

![Early withdrawal configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Early withdrawal settings showing penalty type dropdown, penalty
amount input, grace period field, and withdrawal restrictions selector_

**Typical penalties:**

- 3-month CD: 90 days interest forfeiture
- 12-month CD: 180 days interest forfeiture
- 24-month CD: 365 days interest forfeiture

## Step 3: Configure issuance workflow

Deposit tokens use subscription-based issuance.

### Subscription settings

Define how customers purchase deposits:

**Minimum deposit**

- **Minimum initial deposit** - Smallest certificate amount (e.g., $1,000)
- **Deposit increments** - Allowed denomination steps (e.g., $100 increments)
- **Maximum deposit** - Per-depositor cap (if applicable, e.g., $250,000 FDIC
  limit)

**Subscription period**

Set offering window:

- **Opening date** - When deposit sales begin
- **Closing date** - Last day to purchase deposits (optional)
- **Continuous offering** - Allow rolling deposits with staggered maturities

**Settlement**

- **Subscription settlement** - T+0, T+1, T+2 settlement for deposit funding
- **Funding wallet** - Address where depositors transfer payment tokens

![Subscription configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Subscription settings showing minimum deposit input, increment selector,
subscription period date pickers, and settlement configuration_

### Allocation method

Choose how deposits are issued:

**First-come-first-served**

- Deposits issued immediately upon payment receipt
- No allocation cap (continuous offering)

**Fixed allocation**

- Total deposit pool size specified
- Allocations filled until pool exhausted
- May implement pro-rata allocation if oversubscribed

**Timed issuance**

- Deposits issued on specific dates (e.g., monthly)
- Batched processing of subscription requests

## Step 4: Set compliance rules

Deposit tokens enforce banking regulations and depositor eligibility.

### Regulatory framework selection

Choose applicable regulatory framework:

- **FDIC Insurance** - US bank deposits (up to $250,000 per depositor)
- **EU Deposit Guarantee** - European Economic Area deposits
- **Regulation D (Federal Reserve)** - Reserve requirements and transfer
  restrictions
- **Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)** - AML requirements for deposit accounts
- **Custom** - Jurisdiction-specific banking regulations

The platform pre-configures compliance modules for selected framework.

![Compliance framework selection](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Regulatory framework cards showing FDIC, EU DGS, Reg D, BSA, and
Custom options with deposit insurance and reserve requirement summaries_

### Configure compliance modules

Based on selected framework, configure modules:

**Depositor eligibility**

Set OnchainID claim requirements:

- **KYC/AML verification** - Level 1 (individual) or Level 2 (enhanced)
- **Jurisdiction verification** - Eligible depositor countries
- **Sanctions screening** - Not on OFAC/EU sanctions lists
- **Account type** - Individual, joint, business, trust, retirement account

Only addresses with all required claims can hold deposit tokens.

**Transfer restrictions**

Configure secondary market rules:

**Regulation D compliance** (if applicable):

- **Transfer approval** - Require bank approval for secondary transfers
- **Assignability** - Deposits may be non-transferable until maturity

**Note:** Regulation D transfer limits (6 withdrawals/transfers per month) and
FDIC insurance caps ($250,000 per depositor) must be monitored manually
off-chain. The platform does not automatically enforce these limits. Automated
enforcement features are planned for a future release.

![Compliance module configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Compliance modules showing Depositor Eligibility requirements and
Transfer Restrictions configuration_

**Regulation D important:** Federal Reserve Regulation D historically limited
convenient transfers from savings deposits to 6 per month. You must monitor and
enforce this limit through your deposit operations processes.

## Step 5: Assign operational roles

Grant permissions for deposit management:

### Role assignments

Assign addresses to deposit-specific roles:

**GOVERNANCE_ROLE**

Manages deposit product lifecycle:

- Configure deposit terms
- Set interest rates
- Update maturity parameters
- Manage compliance settings

Typically assigned to: Treasury operations or product management wallet

**SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE**

Controls deposit issuance:

- Mint new deposit tokens (process subscriptions)
- Burn deposit tokens (process redemptions/maturities)
- Batch mint operations

Typically assigned to: Deposit operations wallet

**CUSTODIAN_ROLE**

Handles account operations:

- Freeze compromised accounts
- Execute forced transfers (court orders)
- Recover lost deposits
- Process estate settlements

Typically assigned to: Custodian services or legal compliance wallet

**EMERGENCY_ROLE**

Emergency interventions:

- Pause all transfers
- Pause new deposits
- Activate early redemption during crisis
- Unpause after incident resolution

Typically assigned to: Risk management wallet

![Role assignment interface](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Role assignment form showing four roles with address inputs, role descriptions,
permission lists, and recommended multisig indicators_

**Best practice:** Use multisig wallets for SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE to ensure
dual control over deposit minting and redemptions.

## Step 6: Review and deploy

### Pre-deployment checklist

Verify configuration:

- [ ] Token name and symbol match product documentation
- [ ] Term length and maturity date correct
- [ ] Interest rate matches advertised APR
- [ ] Denomination asset address validated
- [ ] Early withdrawal penalties align with deposit agreement
- [ ] Minimum deposit meets regulatory and business requirements
- [ ] Compliance framework matches banking license
- [ ] All operational roles assigned to secure wallets

![Deployment summary review](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Pre-deployment summary showing deposit parameters, term/rate, subscription
settings, compliance framework, and roles in organized sections_

### Deploy deposit contract

Execute deployment:

1. Click **Deploy Deposit Token**
2. Review transaction details
3. Enter your PIN or OTP for authentication
4. Confirm transaction

The platform:

1. Deploys deposit proxy contract (15-20 seconds)
2. Initializes with your parameters (10 seconds)
3. Configures interest calculation (5 seconds)
4. Assigns roles to specified addresses (5 seconds per role)
5. Registers with identity registry (10 seconds)

Total deployment time: 60-90 seconds

![Deployment progress](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:

and timestamps_

## Step 7: Post-issuance actions

After successful deployment:

### Verify deployment

1. Note the contract address
2. Click **View Deposit Token** to navigate to details page
3. Verify configuration:
   - Token information matches parameters
   - Term length and maturity date correct
   - Interest rate configured properly
   - Roles assigned correctly

![Deposit details overview](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Deposit token details page showing key metrics, term/maturity countdown,
interest rate, total deposits, and depositor count_

### Fund payment wallet

Prepare for interest and redemption payments:

1. Note the payment wallet address shown on **Payments** tab
2. Calculate required reserves:
   - Total expected deposits
   - Total interest liability: deposits × APR × (term / 365)
   - Reserve buffer for early withdrawals
3. Transfer denomination assets to payment wallet
4. Verify balance shows adequate funding

**Funding calculation example:**

- Expected deposits: $1,000,000
- APR: 4%
- Term: 12 months
- Interest liability: $1,000,000 × 0.04 × 1 = $40,000
- Total reserves needed: $1,040,000 + buffer

### Enable subscriptions

Open deposit product for customer purchases:

1. Navigate to **Settings** tab
2. Toggle **Accept Subscriptions** to enabled
3. Confirm subscription period dates correct
4. Review payment wallet configured
5. Save changes

Customers can now purchase deposit tokens.

## Step 8: Manage deposit lifecycle

### Process subscription requests

Handle customer deposit purchases:

**Subscription workflow:**

1. Customer submits deposit purchase via dApp:
   - Enters deposit amount
   - Reviews terms and interest rate
   - Transfers payment tokens to funding wallet
2. Request appears in **Subscriptions** &gt; **Pending** queue
3. Navigate to **Subscriptions** tab
4. Review request details:
   - Customer identity and compliance status
   - Deposit amount
   - Payment token and transaction hash
   - Issue date (determines maturity)
5. Verify payment received in funding wallet
6. Click **Approve Subscription**

**Approval actions:**

- Platform mints deposit tokens to customer address
- Records deposit amount, issue date, maturity date
- Starts interest accrual
- Updates total deposits outstanding

![Subscription queue](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Subscription requests table showing pending deposits with customer, amount,
payment confirmation, issue date, maturity date, and approve button_

**Compliance check:** Platform validates customer OnchainID and enforces
per-depositor insurance limits before minting.

### Track interest accrual

Monitor interest calculations:

1. Navigate to **Interest** tab
2. Review accrual metrics:
   - Total accrued interest across all deposits
   - Interest expense per day
   - Maturity schedule (upcoming interest payments)
   - Payment wallet balance vs. liability

**Interest calculation:**

**Simple interest (at maturity):**

- Interest = Principal × APR × (Term / 365)

**Compound interest (periodic):**

- Interest = Principal × [(1 + APR/n)^(n × Term) - 1]
- Where n = compounding periods per year

Platform calculates interest automatically based on configured method.

![Interest tracking](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Interest
tab showing total accrued interest, daily expense rate, maturity schedule table,
and payment wallet funding status_

### Process maturity redemptions

Handle deposits reaching maturity:

**Maturity workflow:**

1. Platform identifies deposits reaching maturity date
2. Deposits appear in **Maturities** &gt; **Ready for Processing**
3. Navigate to **Maturities** tab
4. Review maturity batch:
   - Deposit holders
   - Principal amounts
   - Interest owed
   - Total redemption amounts
5. Verify payment wallet has sufficient funds
6. Click **Process Maturity Batch**

**Processing actions:**

- Platform calculates redemption proceeds: principal + interest
- Burns deposit tokens from holder addresses
- Transfers proceeds to holders in denomination asset
- Records maturity event in deposit history
- Updates outstanding deposit balance

![Maturity processing](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Maturities tab showing deposits reaching maturity with holder, principal,
interest, total proceeds, and process batch button_

**Automatic processing:** Configure automatic maturity processing to execute
redemptions on maturity date without manual intervention.

### Handle early withdrawal requests

Process pre-maturity redemptions:

**Early withdrawal workflow:**

1. Customer submits early withdrawal request via dApp:
   - Enters withdrawal amount (partial or full)
   - Reviews early withdrawal penalty
   - Confirms request
2. Request appears in **Withdrawals** &gt; **Pending** queue
3. Navigate to **Withdrawals** tab
4. Review request details:
   - Customer address
   - Deposit amount to withdraw
   - Accrued interest (if any)
   - Early withdrawal penalty calculation
   - Net proceeds to customer
5. Verify early withdrawal allowed per deposit terms
6. Click **Approve Withdrawal**

**Penalty calculation example:**

- Principal: $10,000
- Accrued interest: $150 (4.5 months at 4% APR)
- Penalty: 180 days interest = $197
- Net proceeds: $10,000 + $150 - $197 = $9,953

![Early withdrawal queue](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:

penalty, net proceeds, and approve/reject buttons_

**Discretion:** Some early withdrawal requests may require manual review and
approval per banking policies.

## Common workflows

### Handle rollover deposits

Automatically renew maturing deposits:

1. Configure rollover settings before initial maturity:
   - Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Rollover**
   - Enable automatic rollover
   - Set rollover term (same or different duration)
   - Configure new interest rate (current market rate)
2. On maturity date:
   - Platform identifies deposits eligible for rollover
   - Sends notification to depositors
   - Depositors opt-in or opt-out via dApp
3. Process rollovers:
   - Opt-in deposits: Keep tokens, update maturity date, apply new rate
   - Opt-out deposits: Process as normal maturity redemption

**Opt-in default:** Configure whether rollover is opt-in (customer must choose)
or opt-out (automatic unless customer declines).

### Adjust interest rates

Change rates for new deposits:

1. Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Interest Rate**
2. Click **Update Rate**
3. Enter new APR (basis points)
4. Set effective date for new deposits
5. Confirm rate change
6. Requires GOVERNANCE_ROLE permission

**Note:** Interest rate changes apply only to new deposits issued after
effective date. Existing deposits maintain original rate.

### Process bulk deposits

Handle institutional or large deposits:

1. Negotiate deposit terms with institutional customer
2. Navigate to **Actions** &gt; **Issue Bulk Deposit**
3. Enter:
   - Customer address (verified OnchainID required)
   - Deposit amount
   - Custom terms (if negotiated rates differ)
   - Settlement reference
4. Verify large payment received
5. Execute bulk mint
6. Issue confirmation documentation

**Best practice:** Use separate deposit token contracts for wholesale vs. retail
deposits if terms differ significantly.

### Handle escheatment

Process unclaimed matured deposits:

1. Identify deposits matured but not redeemed after dormancy period
   (state-specific, typically 3-5 years)
2. Navigate to **Compliance** &gt; **Unclaimed Property**
3. Review unclaimed deposits list
4. Attempt customer contact per state regulations
5. If no response, transfer to state unclaimed property fund:
   - Burn tokens from holder address
   - Transfer proceeds to state escrow wallet
   - File unclaimed property report with state

Requires compliance with individual state escheatment laws.

## Best practices

**Before deployment:**

- Ensure banking license permits deposit-taking activities
- Verify denomination asset qualifies as legal deposit (stablecoin regulations)
- Configure reserve requirements per Federal Reserve or local regulations
- Prepare deposit insurance documentation (FDIC or equivalent)
- Set up accounting systems for deposit liability tracking

**During operations:**

- Maintain payment wallet with 110-120% of maturity obligations
- Reconcile on-chain deposits with general ledger daily
- Monitor interest accrual for accounting accuracy
- Track per-depositor insurance limits to avoid over-insurance
- Review early withdrawal requests for suspicious patterns
- Execute maturity processing on maturity date (not before/after)

**Regulatory compliance:**

- File call reports (regulatory reporting) including tokenized deposits
- Maintain reserve requirements per Regulation D
- Implement Reg D transfer limits if applicable
- Screen depositors against sanctions lists
- File CTRs (Currency Transaction Reports) for large transactions (&gt;$10,000)
- Maintain depositor records per Bank Secrecy Act

**Customer service:**

- Send maturity reminders 30 days before maturity
- Provide clear disclosure of deposit terms and penalties
- Offer rollover options before maturity
- Maintain customer support for early withdrawal inquiries
- Provide monthly statements showing principal and interest

## Troubleshooting

**Deployment fails with "Invalid term length"**

- Verify term is positive number of days
- Check term is reasonable (typically 30-2,190 days / 1 month to 6 years)
- Ensure term format is correct integer

**Subscription processing reverts**

- Verify customer OnchainID has required KYC claims
- Check deposit amount meets minimum requirement
- Ensure deposit does not exceed per-depositor insurance limit
- Confirm denomination asset payment received in funding wallet

**Maturity processing fails**

- Verify payment wallet has sufficient denomination asset balance
- Check calculation: sum of (principal + interest) for all maturities
- Ensure maturity date has passed (cannot process early)
- Confirm holders have valid OnchainIDs

**Early withdrawal reverts**

- Check early withdrawal is allowed per deposit terms
- Verify penalty calculation is correct
- Ensure payment wallet has sufficient funds for net proceeds
- Confirm customer holds sufficient deposit tokens

**Interest accrual showing incorrect amount**

- Verify deposit issue date is correct
- Check interest rate matches configured APR
- Ensure compounding frequency setting is correct
- Confirm denomination asset decimals factor correctly
