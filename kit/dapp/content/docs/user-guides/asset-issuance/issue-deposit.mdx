**Who should read this:** Treasury operations teams at banks, credit unions, and
deposit-taking institutions exploring blockchain infrastructure for CD products.

**Time required:** 15-20 minutes for initial deployment; ongoing operations
managed through automated workflows.

**Prerequisites:**

- Completed [Getting started](/docs/user-guides/getting-started) onboarding
- Deposit system factory deployed during onboarding
- Denomination asset (payment token) deployed or address available
- Deposit terms defined (term length, interest rate, early withdrawal penalties)
- Banking license or deposit-taking authorization

## Why banks tokenize certificates of deposit

Traditional CD operations burden treasury teams with manual interest
calculations, maturity tracking in spreadsheets, and coordination across
fragmented core banking systems. A 12-month CD portfolio requires manual
intervention at issuance (calculating interest), monthly for accrual
reconciliation, and at maturity for principal repayment—each touchpoint
introducing calculation errors and operational delays.

Tokenized CDs shift this burden to protocol-layer automation. Interest accrues
on-chain according to configured rates, maturity dates trigger automated
redemption workflows, and vault custody eliminates manual coordination between
deposit operations and payment processing teams. The result: **85-95% reduction
in operational costs** and zero calculation errors across the deposit lifecycle.

DALP vault architecture provides an additional advantage traditional systems
cannot match: **atomic delivery-versus-payment settlement**. When a depositor
purchases a CD, the platform locks payment tokens in a vault and mints deposit
tokens in a single transaction—eliminating settlement risk entirely. At
maturity, the redemption reverses this flow atomically: deposit tokens burn
while principal plus interest transfers to the holder simultaneously.

This guide walks you through deploying a compliant deposit token, configuring
yield automation, and operating the full lifecycle from subscription through
maturity processing.

## Navigate to deposit creation

From the main dashboard, select **Asset Management** &gt; **Deposits** &gt;
**Create New Deposit Token**.

The deposit creation wizard guides you through configuration sections: basic
token parameters, term structure, yield settings, early withdrawal rules,
subscription mechanics, compliance framework, and operational role assignments.
Each section builds on DALP vault and automated yield capabilities to eliminate
manual spreadsheet tracking.

## Configure deposit parameters

### Basic token information

Deposit tokens follow standard ERC20 naming conventions with treasury-specific
guidance. Choose names that encode maturity period and term length for portfolio
management clarity.

**Token name:** Include term and maturity
period—`FirstBank 12-Month CD January 2026` clarifies product lifecycle at a
glance across your CD portfolio dashboard.

**Token symbol:** Use compact representations encoding term and
maturity—`FB12M-JAN26` balances readability with DeFi ecosystem compatibility.

**Decimals:** Choose 0 for institutional whole-certificate products ($1,000
minimum increments) or 18 for fractional retail deposits enabling
micro-denominations.

**Initial supply:** Set to 0 for CDs minted on-demand during subscription
processing; alternatively pre-mint a fixed pool for first-come-first-served
allocation.

The platform validates these parameters against regulatory constraints—deposit
token names cannot contain misleading insurance claims, and symbols must remain
unique across your deployed asset portfolio to prevent DeFi integration
conflicts.

### Term structure and maturity mechanics

CD term configuration determines interest calculation methodology, maturity date
computation, and early withdrawal penalty structures. Your choices here cascade
through every downstream workflow—subscription processing, interest accrual,
maturity redemptions.

#### Term length economics

| Term     | Typical APR | Use case                     | Penalty structure            |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 3-month  | 2.5-3.5%    | Short-term liquidity parking | 90 days interest forfeiture  |
| 6-month  | 3.0-4.0%    | Seasonal cash management     | 120 days interest forfeiture |
| 12-month | 3.5-4.5%    | Annual treasury planning     | 180 days interest forfeiture |
| 24-month | 4.0-5.0%    | Long-term rate lock          | 365 days interest forfeiture |
| 36-month | 4.5-5.5%    | Multi-year reserves          | 540 days interest forfeiture |

**Term length** sets deposit duration in days. The platform calculates maturity
date automatically: issue date plus term length, with optional business day
adjustments when maturity falls on weekends or banking holidays.

**Why it matters:** Longer terms demand higher APRs to compensate depositors for
liquidity lockup, but reduce rollover operational burden. A bank issuing 3-month
CDs processes maturity workflows 4× per year per depositor; 12-month terms
reduce this to annual processing, cutting operational costs by 75% while
offering competitive yields.

**Business day adjustment:** Enable this when your treasury operates on
traditional banking calendars. Maturity redemptions scheduled for Saturday
auto-shift to the following Monday, aligning on-chain settlement with
back-office availability.

### Interest rate configuration

Yield settings drive automated interest accrual and maturity proceeds
calculation. The platform supports simple interest (at maturity) and compound
interest (periodic) methodologies—choose based on competitive positioning and
regulatory disclosure requirements.

**Annual percentage rate (APR):** Enter as basis points for precision—4.0% APR
becomes 400 basis points. The platform enforces consistency across UI displays
and smart contract storage, eliminating human error during rate updates.

**Compounding frequency:** Simple interest suits institutional CDs with lump-sum
maturity payouts; monthly/quarterly compounding attracts retail depositors
expecting periodic interest credits. Compound interest increases effective
yield:

- Simple: $10,000 at 4% for 12 months = $10,400 at maturity
- Monthly compound: $10,000 at 4% compounded monthly = $10,407.42 at maturity

**Interest payment method:** Choose **at maturity** for CDs where principal plus
interest pay out as a lump sum, or **periodic distribution** for institutional
products requiring quarterly interest transfers to operating accounts. Periodic
distribution requires vault funding for each payment date; at-maturity requires
single funding event before maturity processing.

**Rate table example:**

| Configuration                                          | Result                     | Vault funding requirement             |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| $1M deposits, 4% APR, 12-month, simple                 | $40,000 interest liability | Fund $1.04M before maturity           |
| $1M deposits, 4% APR, 12-month, quarterly distribution | $10,000 per quarter        | Fund $10K quarterly + $1M at maturity |
| $500K deposits, 5.5% APR, 24-month, simple             | $55,000 interest liability | Fund $555K before maturity            |

The platform calculates these obligations automatically and displays funding
requirements on the **Payments** dashboard—treasury teams monitor vault balance
versus upcoming liability in real time, receiving alerts when reserve ratios
drop below configured thresholds.

### Denomination asset selection

Specify the ERC20 token representing deposit currency. Most institutional
deployments use USDC or USDT for regulatory clarity and deep liquidity; some
deploy custom institutional stablecoins for closed-loop treasury ecosystems.

Enter the denomination asset contract address. The platform validates:

- Contract exists at provided address
- Implements ERC20 `decimals()` function
- Decimals match configured deposit token decimals (or scaling factor
  documented)

**Why it matters:** Denomination asset choice determines DvP settlement
mechanics, fiat bridge integration requirements, and depositor onboarding
friction. USDC benefits from established Circle banking partnerships for fiat
on-ramps; institutional stablecoins offer tighter custody control but require
custom bridge infrastructure.

When a depositor purchases a CD, they transfer denomination assets to the
platform vault; at maturity, the vault transfers principal plus interest back in
the same denomination. This atomic swap eliminates settlement risk inherent to
traditional systems where deposit liability and payment processing operate
across disconnected ledgers.

### Early withdrawal configuration

Early withdrawal rules balance depositor flexibility with treasury liquidity
management. Penalties discourage pre-maturity redemptions that disrupt funding
cost models, but overly restrictive terms harm competitive positioning versus
liquid savings products.

#### Penalty economics

Banks price early withdrawal penalties to recover opportunity cost when
depositors break fixed-rate commitments. The platform automates penalty
calculation, redemption processing, and vault settlement based on configured
rules.

**Penalty structures:**

| Penalty type         | Calculation                        | When to use                | Example                                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Interest forfeiture  | Days × APR                         | Standard retail CDs        | 180-day penalty on 12-month CD = forfeit 6 months interest |
| Principal percentage | Principal × %                      | High-yield promotional CDs | 2% principal penalty = $200 on $10,000 deposit             |
| Fixed fee            | Flat amount                        | Small-denomination retail  | $25 penalty regardless of balance                          |
| Hybrid               | Greater of interest or principal % | Institutional CDs          | Greater of 1% principal or 90 days interest                |

**Grace period:** Optionally allow penalty-free withdrawal during initial days
after issuance—grace periods suit promotional "trial" CDs or satisfy cooling-off
regulations in certain jurisdictions. Set to 0 for standard institutional
products.

**Withdrawal restrictions:** Choose **allowed** for standard CDs with automated
penalty assessment, **restricted** when early withdrawal requires manual
treasury approval (institutional products with negotiated terms), or
**prohibited** for locked products with zero pre-maturity liquidity.

**Why automation matters:** Traditional CD early withdrawal processing requires
manual interest calculation, penalty assessment, core banking coordination, and
customer communication—typically 15-30 minutes per request. The platform
executes this workflow atomically: customer submits request via dApp, platform
calculates penalty, burns deposit tokens, and transfers net proceeds in a single
transaction. Treasury teams review requests in batches rather than handling each
individually.

#### Early withdrawal workflow narrative

When a depositor requests early withdrawal, the platform calculates accrued
interest from issue date to withdrawal date, applies configured penalty rules,
and computes net proceeds. Treasury operators review pending requests on the
**Withdrawals** dashboard:

- **Principal:** $10,000
- **Days held:** 137 days of 365-day term
- **Accrued interest:** $150 (137/365 × 4% × $10,000)
- **Penalty:** 180 days interest = $197 (180/365 × 4% × $10,000)
- **Net proceeds:** $10,000 + $150 - $197 = **$9,953**

Approve the request. The platform burns deposit tokens from the customer
address, transfers $9,953 from the vault to the customer, and records the
withdrawal event in audit logs—all atomically. The entire process takes 30
seconds versus 15-30 minutes in traditional systems.

## Configure subscription mechanics

Deposit tokens use subscription-based issuance: depositors submit purchase
requests, treasury operators approve after verifying payment, and the platform
mints deposit tokens recording issue date and maturity.

### Minimum deposit and increments

**Minimum deposit:** Set based on target customer segment and operational
efficiency. $1,000 minimums suit retail CDs; $100,000 minimums target
institutional treasury desks. The platform enforces minimums during subscription
validation—requests below threshold auto-reject with explanatory messages.

**Deposit increments:** Define allowable denomination steps—$100 increments for
retail flexibility, $10,000 increments for institutional round-lot processing.
Increment enforcement eliminates fractional-cent rounding errors that plague
traditional systems during interest calculations.

**Maximum deposit:** Optionally cap per-depositor exposure. $250,000 maximums
align with FDIC insurance limits for US banks; regulatory frameworks in other
jurisdictions specify different thresholds. The platform validates aggregate
depositor holdings across all maturities when processing
subscriptions—preventing single depositors from exceeding insurance caps even
across multiple CD series.

**Why these constraints matter:** Traditional systems track deposit limits
through manual account aggregation queries against core banking databases.
Tokenized infrastructure encodes limits as protocol rules: subscription
processing automatically queries the depositor's total holdings via the unified
identity registry and rejects over-limit requests instantly. This eliminates
"over-limit" scenarios discovered during manual audit, where depositors exceed
FDIC coverage without real-time detection.

### Subscription period and settlement

**Opening date:** When customers can begin purchasing CDs. Set to immediate for
evergreen products or future dates for scheduled offerings (e.g., "January 2026
CD Series opens December 15, 2025").

**Closing date:** Last day to purchase from this series. Leave blank for
continuous offerings with rolling maturities; set specific dates for fixed-pool
allocations where total issuance caps at a target amount.

**Continuous offering:** Enable this for standard CD products where the bank
issues deposits on-demand as customers subscribe. Disable for limited-allocation
institutional products or promotional CDs with fixed pool sizes.

**Settlement timing:** Choose T+0 (instant settlement), T+1 (next business day),
or T+2 (two business days) based on back-office funding workflows. T+0 suits
blockchain-native operations where payment token transfers occur instantly;
T+1/T+2 align with traditional ACH timelines for banks transitioning from legacy
systems.

**DvP mechanics:** When a customer submits a subscription request, they transfer
payment tokens to the funding wallet address. Treasury operators review pending
requests, verify payment receipt, and approve. The platform mints deposit
tokens, records issue date (determines maturity), and updates total outstanding
deposits—all atomically. Payment tokens remain in the vault custody until
maturity redemption or early withdrawal.

This delivery-versus-payment flow eliminates settlement risk: either both legs
complete (payment received AND deposit tokens issued) or neither completes.
Traditional systems introduce risk windows during the coordination gap between
payment processing and deposit account creation.

### Allocation methods

**First-come-first-served:** Deposits mint on-demand as subscriptions arrive.
Suitable for standard retail CD products with no issuance caps. The platform
processes subscriptions in arrival order, ensuring fairness without manual queue
management.

**Fixed allocation:** Specify total deposit pool size (e.g., $10 million total
issuance cap). The platform tracks remaining allocation and rejects
subscriptions once pool exhausts. Optionally enable pro-rata allocation if total
subscription demand exceeds pool size—the platform automatically scales each
request proportionally and refunds excess payments.

**Timed issuance:** Batch subscriptions for processing on specific dates (e.g.,
first Monday of each month). Treasury teams review the month's accumulated
requests in a single session rather than continuous processing, reducing
operational overhead while maintaining predictable workflows.

**When to use each:** Continuous first-come-first-served suits established CD
products with predictable demand; fixed allocation targets promotional offerings
where marketing campaigns drive surge demand; timed issuance optimizes
operational efficiency for teams managing dozens of concurrent asset products.

## Set compliance framework

Deposit tokens enforce banking regulations through protocol-layer identity
verification and transfer restrictions. Choose a regulatory framework
template—the platform pre-configures compliance modules with appropriate rule
sets, then allows customization for jurisdiction-specific requirements.

### Regulatory framework selection

The platform offers compliance templates encoding common deposit-taking
regulatory regimes. Select the framework matching your banking license and
depositor jurisdiction.

#### Framework comparison

| Framework  | Jurisdiction     | Insurance cap       | Transfer limits             | Identity requirements    | Reserve rules         |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| FDIC       | US banks         | $250k per depositor | Reg D: 6/month from savings | SSN or TIN               | Federal Reserve Reg D |
| EU DGS     | EEA banks        | €100k per depositor | SEPA compliance             | EU identity verification | CRD IV capital rules  |
| Reg D only | US (non-deposit) | None                | 6/month limit               | Accredited investor      | None                  |
| BSA/AML    | US universal     | N/A                 | CTR for &gt;$10k            | CIP verification         | None                  |
| Custom     | Any              | Configurable        | Configurable                | Configurable             | Manual monitoring     |

**FDIC Insurance:** US banks offering insured deposits. The platform enforces
$250,000 per-depositor aggregate limits across all CD series and deposit
products, automating insurance cap tracking that traditionally requires manual
account aggregation queries.

**EU Deposit Guarantee Scheme:** European banks subject to Directive 2014/49/EU.
€100,000 per depositor per institution, with platform validation during
subscription processing.

**Regulation D:** Federal Reserve transfer restrictions on savings deposits
(historically limited to 6 convenient transfers per month). The platform tracks
transfer counts per depositor but does **not** auto-enforce monthly
limits—treasury teams monitor via compliance dashboard and reject excess
transfer requests manually. Automated enforcement planned for future release.

**Bank Secrecy Act (BSA):** AML requirements for US deposit accounts. The
platform integrates OnchainID claim verification for Customer Identification
Program (CIP) compliance and flags large transactions (&gt;$10,000) requiring
Currency Transaction Report (CTR) filing.

**Custom:** Build jurisdiction-specific frameworks using modular compliance
components. Configure insurance caps, transfer rules, and identity requirements
matching local regulations.

**Why framework templates matter:** Traditional compliance implementation
requires engineering teams to hand-code regulatory logic across disconnected
account management, transfer processing, and reporting systems—introducing bugs
and regulatory gaps. DALP compliance-by-design encodes rules as protocol-layer
constraints: smart contracts validate every subscription, transfer, and
redemption against configured requirements before execution. Treasury teams
configure rules once during deployment rather than coordinating updates across
multiple systems.

### Compliance module configuration

Regulatory frameworks activate specific compliance modules. Configure each
module based on your operational requirements and regulatory obligations.

#### Depositor eligibility requirements

OnchainID claims gate deposit token acquisition and holding. Only addresses with
required claims can subscribe to CDs or receive transfers. The platform
validates claims at subscription time and before every transfer—ensuring
continuous compliance even if claim revocation occurs post-issuance.

**Required claims:**

**KYC/AML verification:** Choose verification level:

- **Level 1 (individual):** Name, address, date of birth, government ID—suits
  retail depositors
- **Level 2 (enhanced):** Level 1 plus beneficial ownership, source of
  funds—required for high-value deposits or institutional accounts

**Jurisdiction verification:** Specify eligible depositor countries. US banks
typically restrict to US persons; cross-border offerings require
multi-jurisdiction compliance documentation.

**Sanctions screening:** Platform validates addresses against OFAC/EU sanctions
lists via integrated screening providers. Subscriptions from sanctioned
addresses auto-reject; existing holders flagged for freeze if added to lists
post-issuance.

**Account type:** Categorize depositors as individual, joint, business, trust,
or retirement account. Insurance limits and tax reporting vary by type—platform
enforces type-specific rules during subscription processing.

**Observability integration:** The compliance dashboard displays depositor claim
status in real time. Treasury teams monitor claim expiration dates and receive
alerts when depositors approach renewal deadlines—preventing scenarios where
maturing CDs cannot redeem due to expired identity verification.

#### Transfer restrictions

Configure secondary market transferability based on regulatory requirements and
product design.

**Regulation D compliance:** Enable transfer approval requirements when Reg D
applies. Each transfer request queues for treasury operator review; approvals
execute instantly while rejections notify the requestor with explanatory
messages.

**Assignability:** Choose freely transferable (standard), transfer-restricted
(requires approval), or non-transferable (prohibited until maturity).
Non-transferable CDs eliminate secondary market liquidity but simplify
regulatory compliance for banks avoiding securities classification.

**Monthly transfer limits:** The platform tracks transfer counts per depositor
per calendar month. Configure alert thresholds (e.g., warn at 5 transfers,
notify compliance team at 6) but note that **automatic monthly limit enforcement
is not yet implemented**—treasury teams review dashboards and manually reject
excess requests. Automated enforcement targeting next major release.

**FDIC insurance coordination:** The platform validates per-depositor aggregate
holdings across all CD series during subscription, but does **not** track
insurance allocations across multiple institutions or account ownership
structures (e.g., revocable trusts, retirement accounts with separate coverage).
Treasury teams must monitor these scenarios manually using compliance reporting
tools. Full insurance tracking automation planned for future development.

#### Why protocol-layer compliance beats middleware

Traditional deposit systems implement compliance as middleware between core
banking and account management—introducing coordination delays, rule
synchronization bugs, and audit gaps when subsystems diverge. A depositor might
pass KYC in the CRM but fail transfer restrictions in the core banking module if
updates propagate slowly.

DALP compliance-by-design encodes rules in smart contracts governing token
transfers. Every subscription, transfer, and redemption executes compliance
checks atomically—validation and settlement occur in the same transaction. This
eliminates race conditions where compliance status changes between check and
execution, a common failure mode in distributed legacy architectures.

## Assign operational roles

Deposit operations require segregated roles preventing privilege escalation
while enabling efficient workflows. The platform implements role-based access
control (RBAC) at the smart contract level—only addresses with appropriate roles
can execute privileged functions.

### Role assignments and permissions

**GOVERNANCE_ROLE:** Treasury product management

- Configure deposit terms, interest rates, maturity parameters
- Update compliance settings and regulatory framework
- Modify early withdrawal rules and penalty structures
- Adjust subscription periods and allocation methods

Assign to: Treasury operations multisig wallet (recommended 2-of-3 or 3-of-5
threshold)

**SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE:** Deposit issuance and redemption

- Mint deposit tokens during subscription approval
- Burn deposit tokens during maturity processing or early withdrawal
- Execute batch operations for efficiency
- Process rollover renewals

Assign to: Deposit operations multisig wallet (recommended 2-of-3 threshold for
dual control)

**CUSTODIAN_ROLE:** Account administration

- Freeze compromised depositor addresses (fraud, court orders)
- Execute forced transfers (estate settlements, legal judgments)
- Recover deposits from lost private keys (with legal documentation)
- Unfreeze addresses after incident resolution

Assign to: Custodian services or legal compliance multisig wallet

**EMERGENCY_ROLE:** Crisis intervention

- Pause all transfers during security incidents
- Halt new subscriptions during system maintenance
- Enable emergency early redemption during bank run scenarios
- Unpause after incident resolution

Assign to: Risk management multisig wallet with documented emergency procedures

**Why multisig matters:** Single-key wallets introduce catastrophic key
compromise risk—if an operations laptop is compromised, attackers can mint
unlimited deposit tokens or drain vaults. Multisig wallets require M-of-N
signatures, distributing key custody across multiple secure hardware devices and
personnel. A 2-of-3 SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE configuration means deposit minting
requires two operators' signatures, preventing rogue employee attacks while
maintaining operational efficiency.

**Operational workflow:** Treasury operators collaborate using multisig
coordination tools. When processing subscription batches, operator A initiates
the batch mint transaction, operator B reviews pending subscriptions and
approves, and the transaction executes only after both signatures confirm. This
enforces dual control without manual coordination overhead.

## Review and deploy

Before deployment, verify configuration against product documentation and
regulatory requirements. The platform displays a comprehensive pre-deployment
summary consolidating all parameters.

**Pre-deployment verification:**

1. **Token parameters:** Name, symbol, decimals match product documentation
2. **Term structure:** Length and maturity calculation align with marketing
   materials
3. **Interest configuration:** APR, compounding frequency, payment method match
   advertised terms
4. **Denomination asset:** Validated contract address with correct decimals
5. **Early withdrawal:** Penalty rules match deposit agreement disclosures
6. **Subscription settings:** Minimums, increments, and caps align with
   regulatory and business requirements
7. **Compliance framework:** Selected framework matches banking license and
   depositor jurisdiction
8. **Role assignments:** All roles assigned to secure multisig wallets with
   documented signers

The platform flags configuration conflicts automatically (e.g., 24-month term
with 365-day early withdrawal penalty exceeds term length) and blocks deployment
until resolved.

### Execute deployment

Click **Deploy Deposit Token**. Review transaction details including estimated
gas cost and deployment address. Enter PIN or OTP for authentication, then
confirm.

**Deployment sequence:**

1. Deploy deposit proxy contract (15-20 seconds)
2. Initialize with configured parameters (10 seconds)
3. Configure interest calculation module (5 seconds)
4. Assign operational roles to specified addresses (5 seconds per role)
5. Register with identity registry for compliance validation (10 seconds)

Total deployment time: 60-90 seconds

The platform displays real-time deployment progress with transaction hashes for
audit trail documentation. Upon completion, note the contract address and
navigate to the deposit details page to verify configuration.

## Post-deployment configuration

Deployment creates the deposit token contract, but additional setup enables
subscription processing and operational workflows.

### Verify deployment

Navigate to **Asset Management** &gt; **Deposits** and select your newly
deployed deposit token. The details page displays:

- **Token information:** Name, symbol, decimals, contract address
- **Term structure:** Length, maturity date calculation, business day adjustment
- **Interest configuration:** APR, compounding frequency, payment method
- **Compliance framework:** Active modules and rules
- **Role assignments:** Addresses holding operational permissions
- **Current status:** Total deposits outstanding (initially 0), depositor count,
  vault balance

Verify each parameter matches intended configuration. Discrepancies indicate
deployment errors requiring redeployment.

### Fund payment vault

The platform maintains a dedicated vault for deposit redemptions and interest
payments. Treasury teams must fund this vault before enabling
subscriptions—insufficient vault balance prevents maturity processing.

**Funding calculation:**

Calculate total reserve requirement:

- **Expected total deposits:** Maximum issuance target (or estimate for
  continuous offerings)
- **Interest liability:** Total deposits × APR × (term length / 365 days)
- **Reserve buffer:** 10-20% cushion for early withdrawals and operational
  flexibility

**Example funding calculation:**

- Expected deposits: $1,000,000
- APR: 4%
- Term: 12 months
- Interest liability: $1,000,000 × 0.04 × (365/365) = $40,000
- Buffer (15%): $156,000
- **Total vault funding required:** $1,196,000

Navigate to **Payments** tab. Note the vault wallet address. Transfer
denomination assets (USDC, USDT, etc.) to this address. The dashboard updates
vault balance in real time—verify sufficient funding before enabling
subscriptions.

**Why funding matters:** Maturity processing executes atomically: deposit tokens
burn AND redemption proceeds transfer in a single transaction. If vault balance
falls below required redemption amount, the transaction reverts. Traditional
systems allow maturity processing to "succeed" even when payment accounts lack
funds, creating reconciliation nightmares and customer complaints. DALP atomic
settlement eliminates this failure mode.

**Observability integration:** The **Vault Monitoring** dashboard displays
real-time metrics:

- **Current balance:** Denomination asset holdings in vault
- **Total liability:** Sum of principal plus accrued interest for all
  outstanding deposits
- **Reserve ratio:** Balance / liability (target: &gt;100%)
- **Upcoming maturities:** 7-day and 30-day maturity schedules with funding
  requirements
- **Alerts:** Notifications when reserve ratio drops below configured threshold
  (default: 105%)

Treasury teams monitor these metrics daily, topping up vault funding proactively
to maintain operational continuity.

### Enable subscriptions

With vault funded, activate subscription processing.

Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Subscriptions**. Toggle **Accept Subscriptions**
to enabled. Verify subscription period dates (opening and closing dates) match
product launch timeline. Confirm payment wallet address displays
correctly—customers transfer denomination assets to this address when submitting
subscription requests.

Save changes. The deposit product is now live—customers can purchase CDs via the
dApp interface.

## Manage deposit lifecycle

Deposit operations follow a predictable workflow: subscriptions &gt; interest
accrual &gt; maturity processing (or early withdrawals). The platform automates
calculation-intensive tasks while providing dashboards for treasury operator
oversight and approval.

### Process subscription requests

Customers submit deposit purchases via the dApp: enter deposit amount, review
terms and APR, transfer payment tokens to the funding wallet, and submit
request. The platform validates minimum/increment/maximum rules, checks identity
claims, and queues the request for treasury approval.

**Subscription workflow narrative:**

Navigate to **Subscriptions** &gt; **Pending**. The queue displays customer
requests with key details:

- **Customer address:** OnchainID-linked Ethereum address
- **Compliance status:** Green checkmark if all required claims valid; yellow
  warning if claims expire within 30 days; red X if missing required claims
- **Deposit amount:** Requested purchase size
- **Payment status:** Confirmed (payment received in funding wallet) or pending
  (awaiting transfer)
- **Issue date:** Date deposit tokens will mint (determines maturity
  calculation)
- **Maturity date:** Auto-calculated from issue date plus term length

Review each request:

1. **Verify compliance:** Ensure customer identity claims satisfy framework
   requirements
2. **Confirm payment:** Check payment transaction hash and vault balance
   reflects received funds
3. **Validate amount:** Confirm deposit meets minimum, follows increments, and
   doesn't exceed customer's insurance limit
4. **Check issue date:** Verify aligns with business day calendar if applicable

Click **Approve Subscription**. The platform executes atomically:

1. Mints deposit tokens to customer address (quantity: deposit amount /
   denomination unit)
2. Records issue date and maturity date in token metadata
3. Starts interest accrual calculation
4. Updates total deposits outstanding metric
5. Transfers payment tokens from funding wallet to vault custody

The customer receives deposit tokens immediately, visible in their dApp wallet.
Issue date determines maturity—a 12-month CD issued January 15, 2026 matures
January 15, 2027.

**Batch processing:** Select multiple pending subscriptions and click **Approve
Batch** for efficient processing. The platform executes a single multi-mint
transaction, reducing gas costs by 60-80% versus individual approvals.

**Observability integration:** The subscription dashboard displays real-time
metrics:

- **Pending count:** Requests awaiting approval
- **Average approval time:** SLA metric for operational efficiency monitoring
- **Rejection rate:** Percentage rejected due to compliance failures or payment
  issues
- **Daily subscription volume:** New deposits issued per day
- **Cumulative deposits:** Total outstanding principal across all maturities

### Track interest accrual

Interest accrues automatically based on configured APR, compounding frequency,
and payment method. Treasury teams monitor accrual to ensure vault funding
remains adequate for upcoming liabilities.

Navigate to **Interest** tab. The dashboard displays accrual metrics:

**Total accrued interest:** Sum of interest earned across all outstanding
deposits from issue date to current date. Updates continuously as time
progresses.

**Daily interest expense:** Interest accruing per day across entire portfolio.
Calculate as: total outstanding deposits × APR / 365.

**Maturity schedule:** Calendar view showing upcoming maturity dates, principal
amounts, and interest liabilities. Use this to plan vault funding top-ups before
large maturity batches.

**Payment wallet status:** Current balance versus total liability (principal
plus accrued interest). Green indicator when balance &gt;105% of liability;
yellow warning at 100-105%; red alert below 100%.

**Interest calculation examples:**

**Simple interest (at maturity):**

- Principal: $10,000
- APR: 4%
- Term: 12 months
- Interest: $10,000 × 0.04 × (365/365) = **$400**
- Maturity proceeds: **$10,400**

**Monthly compound interest:**

- Principal: $10,000
- APR: 4%
- Term: 12 months
- Compounding: Monthly (n=12)
- Interest: $10,000 × [(1 + 0.04/12)^12 - 1] = **$407.42**
- Maturity proceeds: **$10,407.42**

The platform handles these calculations automatically, eliminating spreadsheet
errors that plague traditional treasury operations. Interest accrual updates
every block (approximately every 12 seconds on Ethereum mainnet), providing
real-time liability tracking versus traditional systems where accrual runs
nightly in batch jobs.

**Why automated accrual matters:** Traditional CD portfolios require manual
interest calculation for each certificate at maturity, with treasury teams
maintaining spreadsheets tracking issue dates, terms, rates, and compounding
rules. A 1,000-certificate portfolio requires 1,000 manual calculations at
maturity—each introducing potential errors. Portfolio managers report **10-15%
error rates** in manual interest calculations, requiring reconciliation
processes that delay maturity processing by 2-5 business days.

DALP automated yield eliminates this entirely. Interest formulas execute as
smart contract functions—identical calculations across all deposits, zero human
error, instant results. Treasury teams review final proceeds rather than
calculating them.

### Process maturity redemptions

Deposits reaching maturity appear automatically in the **Maturities** &gt;
**Ready for Processing** queue. The platform identifies matured deposits daily
and prepares batch redemption transactions for treasury approval.

**Maturity workflow narrative:**

Navigate to **Maturities** tab. The queue displays deposits reaching maturity:

| Depositor     | Principal   | Accrued Interest | Total Proceeds | Maturity Date |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| 0x742d...3f8a | $10,000     | $400.00          | $10,400.00     | Jan 15, 2027  |
| 0x8b3c...92e1 | $25,000     | $1,000.00        | $26,000.00     | Jan 15, 2027  |
| 0x1a5d...4c7b | $5,000      | $200.00          | $5,200.00      | Jan 15, 2027  |
| **Total**     | **$40,000** | **$1,600.00**    | **$41,600.00** |               |

Review the batch:

1. **Verify vault funding:** Confirm vault balance ≥ total proceeds ($41,600 in
   this example)
2. **Check maturity dates:** Ensure all deposits actually matured (maturity date
   ≤ today)
3. **Validate depositor claims:** Confirm all depositors maintain valid identity
   claims (required for redemption transfers)

Click **Process Maturity Batch**. The platform executes atomically:

1. Calculates redemption proceeds for each deposit: principal + interest
2. Burns deposit tokens from depositor addresses
3. Transfers proceeds to depositors in denomination asset (USDC, USDT, etc.)
4. Records maturity event in audit logs
5. Updates total deposits outstanding metric

**DvP settlement:** Maturity processing demonstrates DALP atomic settlement.
Token burn and proceeds transfer occur in a single transaction—either both
complete or both revert. Traditional systems coordinate burn and payment across
separate subsystems, introducing windows where one leg completes but the other
fails (e.g., deposit account closed but payment not sent). This creates
reconciliation nightmares requiring manual investigation and correction. Atomic
execution eliminates this failure mode entirely.

**Automatic processing:** Enable **Automatic Maturity Processing** in settings
to execute redemptions on maturity date without manual intervention. The
platform monitors for matured deposits, validates vault funding, and processes
batches automatically—reducing operational overhead to zero for standard
maturity workflows. Treasury teams receive notifications of completed batches
for reconciliation rather than initiating each batch manually.

**Observability integration:** The maturities dashboard displays:

- **Upcoming 7-day maturities:** Early warning for vault funding planning
- **Upcoming 30-day maturities:** Monthly cash flow forecasting
- **Historical maturity processing time:** SLA metric from maturity date to
  redemption execution
- **Maturity processing cost:** Average gas cost per redemption transaction

### Handle early withdrawal requests

Customers submit early withdrawal requests via the dApp when they need
pre-maturity liquidity. The platform calculates applicable penalties, computes
net proceeds, and queues requests for treasury approval.

**Early withdrawal workflow narrative:**

Navigate to **Withdrawals** &gt; **Pending**. The queue displays early
withdrawal requests:

| Customer      | Principal | Accrued Interest | Penalty | Net Proceeds | Days Held  | Request Date |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| 0x742d...3f8a | $10,000   | $150.00          | $197.00 | $9,953.00    | 137 of 365 | Oct 28, 2025 |
| 0x8b3c...92e1 | $25,000   | $375.00          | $493.00 | $24,882.00   | 137 of 365 | Oct 29, 2025 |

**Penalty calculation detail (first request):**

- **Principal:** $10,000
- **Issue date:** Jun 13, 2025
- **Request date:** Oct 28, 2025
- **Days held:** 137 days of 365-day term
- **Accrued interest:** $10,000 × 0.04 × (137/365) = **$150.00**
- **Penalty configuration:** 180 days interest forfeiture
- **Penalty amount:** $10,000 × 0.04 × (180/365) = **$197.00**
- **Net proceeds:** $10,000 + $150 - $197 = **$9,953.00**

Review each request:

1. **Verify early withdrawal allowed:** Confirm deposit terms permit
   pre-maturity withdrawal
2. **Check penalty calculation:** Validate platform calculation matches
   configured penalty rules
3. **Confirm vault funding:** Ensure vault balance ≥ net proceeds
4. **Assess discretionary factors:** For manual-approval products, evaluate
   customer circumstances per banking policies

Click **Approve Withdrawal** (or **Reject** with explanatory note for customer
notification). Upon approval, the platform executes atomically:

1. Burns deposit tokens from customer address
2. Transfers net proceeds to customer in denomination asset
3. Credits penalty amount to vault reserves (retained by institution)
4. Records withdrawal event in audit logs
5. Updates total deposits outstanding metric

**Batch processing:** Select multiple withdrawal requests and process as a batch
for efficiency.

**Observability integration:** The withdrawals dashboard displays:

- **Pending withdrawal count:** Requests awaiting treasury review
- **Average withdrawal size:** Portfolio metric for liquidity forecasting
- **Penalty collected (MTD/YTD):** Revenue from early withdrawal penalties
- **Withdrawal rate:** Percentage of deposits withdrawn early (portfolio health
  metric)

Sustained high withdrawal rates indicate competitive rate disadvantages or
customer liquidity stress—treasury teams use this metric for product pricing
adjustments and portfolio risk assessment.

## Common workflows

### Configure rollover automation

Maturing deposits often renew for additional terms rather than redeeming to
cash. Rollover automation eliminates manual coordination with depositors at
maturity, reducing operational overhead while maintaining deposit balances.

Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Rollover Configuration** before initial
maturities approach. Configure:

**Rollover eligibility:** Choose opt-in (depositors explicitly elect rollover)
or opt-out (automatic renewal unless depositor declines).

**Rollover term:** Same as original (12-month CD renews for 12 months) or
different (upgrade to longer/shorter term).

**Rollover rate:** Current market rate (adjusts to prevailing APR at rollover
time) or locked rate (maintains original APR).

**Notification timeline:** Days before maturity to notify depositors of pending
rollover (typically 30 days).

**Depositor election deadline:** Days before maturity to submit rollover
preference (typically 7 days).

**Rollover workflow at maturity:**

1. **30 days before maturity:** Platform sends notification to depositors via
   dApp and email (if configured) listing rollover terms and election deadline
2. **Depositors elect:** Opt-in to rollover with new terms, or opt-out to
   receive redemption proceeds
3. **7 days before maturity:** Election period closes; platform tallies rollover
   vs redemption counts
4. **Maturity date:**
   - **Rollover deposits:** Platform updates maturity date (+12 months if same
     term), applies new APR if configured, maintains deposit tokens (no
     burn/mint), continues interest accrual
   - **Redemption deposits:** Process as standard maturity (burn tokens,
     transfer proceeds)

**Why rollover automation matters:** Traditional CD rollovers require manual
outreach to each depositor, paper forms or phone banking to collect elections,
manual data entry to update core banking maturity dates, and coordination with
interest calculation systems to apply new rates. This process typically requires
**5-10 minutes per depositor** and introduces errors when elections misrecorded
or maturity updates fail to propagate.

DALP rollover automation encodes the entire workflow as smart contract logic.
Depositors submit elections via dApp (cryptographically signed, tamper-proof),
the platform tallies automatically, and maturity updates execute atomically on
maturity date. Treasury teams monitor rollover rates via dashboard rather than
executing individual renewals.

**Observability integration:** The rollover dashboard displays:

- **Upcoming rollovers (30-day):** Deposits approaching maturity with rollover
  potential
- **Election rate:** Percentage of depositors choosing rollover vs redemption
- **Rollover impact:** Projected deposit balance retention after maturity
  processing
- **Historical rollover trends:** Portfolio metric tracking renewal patterns
  over time

### Adjust interest rates for new issuance

Market conditions change; competitive CD rates fluctuate. The platform enables
interest rate adjustments for new deposits without affecting existing
certificates.

Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Interest Rate**. Click **Update Rate**.

Enter new APR in basis points (e.g., 450 for 4.5% APR). Set effective
date—typically immediate for next subscription, or future date for planned rate
changes aligned with marketing campaigns.

**Critical:** Interest rate changes apply **only to deposits issued after
effective date**. Existing deposits maintain original APR locked at
issuance—this is a core CD product feature ensuring rate certainty for
depositors.

The platform records rate change events in audit logs, displaying historical
rate timeline on the deposit details page. Customers see current rate when
subscribing; treasury teams track weighted average APR across portfolio for
interest expense forecasting.

### Process bulk institutional deposits

Institutional depositors (corporate treasury desks, fund managers) often
negotiate custom terms or deposit large amounts requiring special handling. Bulk
deposit processing accommodates these scenarios.

Navigate to **Actions** &gt; **Issue Bulk Deposit**. This workflow bypasses
standard subscription queue for direct issuance.

Enter:

- **Customer address:** OnchainID-verified institutional account
- **Deposit amount:** Negotiated principal (often exceeding standard maximum
  limits)
- **Custom terms:** If negotiated rate differs from standard APR, or term length
  varies
- **Settlement reference:** Wire transfer reference or payment confirmation
  number

Verify large payment received in vault (check transaction hash or bank wire
confirmation). Click **Execute Bulk Mint**.

The platform mints deposit tokens directly to institutional address, recording
issue date and custom terms. This bypasses subscription approval queue for
efficiency while maintaining compliance validation (OnchainID claims still
required).

**Best practice:** Use separate deposit token contracts for wholesale versus
retail deposits when terms differ significantly (e.g., institutional negotiated
rates vary from retail published rates). Separate contracts prevent confusion
and simplify compliance reporting when regulatory frameworks differ across
customer segments.

### Handle unclaimed deposits (escheatment)

Deposits matured but not redeemed after extended periods trigger escheatment
obligations—state laws require transferring unclaimed property to government
custody for eventual reunification with owners.

Navigate to **Compliance** &gt; **Unclaimed Property**. The platform identifies
deposits matured but not redeemed after configured dormancy period
(state-specific: typically 3-5 years for CDs).

**Escheatment workflow:**

1. **Identify dormant deposits:** Platform flags deposits matured &gt; dormancy
   period without redemption
2. **Attempt contact:** Send notifications to depositor addresses per state due
   diligence requirements (certified mail, email)
3. **Wait for response period:** State-mandated notification period (typically
   60-180 days)
4. **If no response:** Execute escheatment
   - Burn deposit tokens from holder address
   - Transfer proceeds (principal + interest) to state unclaimed property fund
     address
   - File unclaimed property report with state comptroller
   - Record escheatment event in audit logs

**State-specific compliance:** Escheatment rules vary by depositor state of
residence—dormancy periods, due diligence requirements, and reporting formats
differ across jurisdictions. The platform provides base workflow automation;
treasury teams must configure state-specific parameters and ensure reporting
format compliance.

**Why this matters:** Banks face significant fines for escheatment
non-compliance—unclaimed property audits by states regularly uncover unreported
dormant accounts. Tokenized infrastructure provides automated dormancy tracking
and audit trails proving due diligence efforts, reducing compliance risk versus
manual spreadsheet tracking of matured-but-unredeemed CDs.

## Best practices

**Before deployment:**

Ensure legal and regulatory foundations support tokenized deposit operations.
Verify banking license permits deposit-taking activities in blockchain
infrastructure—some jurisdictions require explicit regulatory approval. Confirm
denomination asset (stablecoin) qualifies as legal tender for deposit purposes
per local banking regulations. Configure reserve requirements per Federal
Reserve Regulation D or local equivalents. Prepare deposit insurance
documentation (FDIC coverage confirmation or equivalent scheme membership).
Establish accounting systems tracking on-chain deposit liabilities in general
ledger for regulatory reporting.

**During operations:**

Maintain vault funding discipline. Target 110-120% reserve ratio (vault balance
/ total liability) to accommodate early withdrawal surges and operational
flexibility. Reconcile on-chain deposits with general ledger daily—the
observability dashboard exports deposit balances for accounting system
integration. Monitor interest accrual for P&L accuracy; automated calculations
eliminate errors but treasury teams verify accrual methodology matches financial
reporting standards. Track per-depositor insurance limits to prevent
over-insurance scenarios where single depositors exceed FDIC/DGS caps. Review
early withdrawal patterns for anomalies indicating fraud or customer distress.
Execute maturity processing on maturity date—processing early (even by hours)
violates interest calculation assumptions; processing late delays customer fund
access and harms service quality metrics.

**Regulatory compliance:**

File regulatory reports including tokenized deposits in aggregate balance
calculations. US banks include tokenized CDs in quarterly Call Reports (FFIEC
reporting). Maintain reserve requirements per Regulation D if applicable—the
platform tracks deposits but does not automatically calculate Federal Reserve
reserve obligations (requires manual computation based on total deposit
balances). Implement Reg D transfer limits monitoring (6 convenient transfers
per month from savings deposits) through compliance dashboard review—automated
enforcement not yet available. Screen depositors against sanctions lists
continuously, not just at subscription—the platform integrates with screening
providers for ongoing monitoring. File Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) for
large transactions exceeding $10,000—the observability dashboard flags
qualifying events. Maintain depositor records per Bank Secrecy Act (5-year
retention minimum)—audit logs provide immutable record suitable for regulatory
examination.

**Customer service:**

Proactive communication reduces operational friction. Send maturity reminders 30
days before maturity date informing depositors of redemption timeline and
rollover options. Provide clear disclosure of deposit terms, interest
calculations, and early withdrawal penalties during subscription—the platform
embeds terms in transaction metadata for customer review before confirmation.
Offer rollover options before maturity through automated workflows rather than
requiring customer-initiated contact. Maintain customer support channels for
early withdrawal inquiries—some depositors require explanation of penalty
calculations before proceeding. Provide monthly statements showing principal
balance, accrued interest, and maturity date—the dApp displays this information
on-demand, but many customers prefer periodic email summaries.

## Troubleshooting

**Deployment fails with "Invalid term length"**

Verify term length is positive integer representing days. Check term is
reasonable—platform enforces minimum 7 days and maximum 3,650 days (10 years) to
prevent configuration errors. Ensure term format matches expected integer type
(no decimal values).

**Subscription processing reverts with "Identity verification failed"**

Verify customer OnchainID has all required claims per configured compliance
framework. Navigate to **Compliance** &gt; **Identity Verification** and search
customer address. The platform displays missing claims—customer must complete
KYC process and obtain required claims before subscription approval. Check claim
expiration dates; expired claims fail validation even if previously valid.

**Subscription rejected with "Exceeds insurance limit"**

Customer's aggregate deposits across all CD series exceed per-depositor
insurance cap ($250,000 FDIC or configured limit). The platform queries total
customer holdings via identity registry and validates subscription against cap.
Customer must either reduce subscription amount or redeem existing deposits
before purchasing additional CDs. For institutional customers with negotiated
insurance arrangements, update per-depositor limit in **Settings** &gt;
**Compliance** &gt; **Insurance Caps**.

**Maturity processing fails with "Insufficient vault balance"**

Vault balance &lt; total redemption proceeds (sum of principal + interest for
all matured deposits in batch). Navigate to **Payments** &gt; **Vault Funding**
and transfer additional denomination assets to vault address. Required funding:
total proceeds + 10% buffer. After funding transfer confirms, retry maturity
processing. Enable vault funding alerts in **Settings** &gt; **Notifications**
to receive warnings before balance drops below required thresholds—proactive
monitoring prevents maturity processing failures.

**Early withdrawal reverts with "Withdrawal not permitted"**

Check deposit terms configuration: early withdrawal may be disabled entirely
(prohibited setting) or require manual approval (restricted setting). Navigate
to **Settings** &gt; **Early Withdrawal** and verify configuration. If
prohibited, customer cannot withdraw until maturity—inform customer of maturity
date and suggest alternative liquidity sources. If restricted, queue request for
treasury team review rather than automatic processing.

**Interest accrual showing incorrect amount**

Verify deposit issue date is accurate—interest accrual starts from issue date,
not subscription request date. Check configured APR matches intended rate—the
platform displays configured rate on **Settings** &gt; **Interest Rate** page.
Ensure compounding frequency setting matches product documentation (simple vs
monthly/quarterly compound produces different accruals). Confirm denomination
asset decimals factor correctly into interest calculation—18-decimal tokens
require scaling factor adjustments for human-readable interest amounts. For
technical deep-dive, see
[Contract Reference](/docs/developer-guides/smart-contracts/contract-reference)
interest calculation implementation.

[Troubleshooting](/docs/user-guides/troubleshooting) or contact support.

## Next steps

**Configure fiat integration:** Set up
[Fiat bridge](/docs/user-guides/operations/fiat-bridge) for traditional banking
interoperability—customers deposit USD via ACH/wire, platform converts to
denomination asset (USDC), then processes CD subscription automatically.

**Manage depositor identities:** Review
[Manage investors](/docs/user-guides/operations/manage-investors) for OnchainID
workflows, KYC claim issuance, and identity lifecycle management.

**Monitor compliance metrics:** Deep dive into
[Compliance certification](/docs/architecture/quality/compliance-certification)
for audit trail architecture, regulatory reporting automation, and SOC 2 control
mapping.

**Automate operations:** Configure automatic maturity processing to eliminate
manual batch reviews—platform executes redemptions on maturity date without
treasury intervention. Configure rollover workflows for deposit retention
automation. Enable vault funding alerts to maintain reserve ratios proactively.

**Expand product portfolio:** Deploy additional CD series with varying terms and
rates for customer segmentation—3-month liquidity products, 24-month yield
products. Use separate deposit token contracts for each series to simplify
compliance tracking and interest rate management.
