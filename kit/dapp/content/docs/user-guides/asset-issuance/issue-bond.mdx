## Overview

Deploy a compliant bond token with optional yield distribution and redemption
capabilities at maturity. Bond tokens represent fixed-term debt instruments
backed by denomination assets (typically stablecoins).

**Primary audience:** Corporate treasurers, investment bankers issuing tokenized
bonds  
**Secondary audience:** Financial operations personnel, debt capital markets
teams

**Bond tokens progress through four lifecycle states**: Issued state begins at
deployment when initial tokens are minted and compliance rules become active.
Active state covers the trading period where holders can transfer bonds (subject
to compliance checks) and claim coupon payments if yield is enabled. Matured
state triggers at the configured maturity date, enabling redemption but
typically freezing secondary trading. Redeemed state marks the end when all
tokens have been burned in exchange for denomination assets. The state machine
enforces proper sequencing—bonds cannot skip states or move backward.

## Before you start

**Prerequisites:**

- Completed [Getting started](/docs/user-guides/onboarding/getting-started)
  onboarding
- Bond system factory deployed during onboarding
- Denomination asset (collateral token) deployed or address available
- Bond terms defined (principal, coupon rate, maturity, currency)

**Time estimate:** 15-20 minutes for bond deployment; additional time for yield
configuration

**Required knowledge:**

- Basic blockchain wallet operations
- Understanding of bond instruments (face value, maturity, coupon rates)
- Familiarity with securities regulations (Reg D, Reg S, etc.)

## Steps

<Steps>

<Step>

### Navigate to bond creation

From your dashboard:

1. Click **Asset Management** in the left sidebar
2. Select **Bonds** from the asset type list
3. Click **Create New Bond Token**

![Bond creation navigation](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Asset Management section showing Bonds category with existing bonds list and
Create New Bond Token button_

</Step>

<Step>

### Configure bond parameters

#### Basic token information

Enter your token details:

- **Token name** - Full legal name of the bond offering (e.g., "TechCorp 2027
  Senior Secured Notes")
- **Token symbol** - Trading symbol (e.g., "TECH27")
- **Decimals** - Token divisibility (18 for fractional bonds, 0 for whole-unit
  bonds)
- **Initial supply** - Number of tokens to mint at deployment (or 0 to mint
  later)

![Bond basic information](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Bond
configuration form showing name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply input
fields with validation_

**Naming tip:** Include issuer name, maturity year, and security type for clear
identification (e.g., "TechCorp 2027 Senior Secured Notes").

#### Bond-specific parameters

Configure your debt instrument properties:

**Maturity date**

Set the timestamp when the bond matures and becomes redeemable:

1. Click the date picker field
2. Select maturity date (must be future date)
3. The platform converts to Unix timestamp automatically

Typical corporate bonds have 1-10 year maturities.

**Face value**

Enter the redemption value per token at maturity:

- Specified in denomination asset units
- Typically set to 1000 (representing $1,000 face value per bond)
- Determines redemption amount: tokens × face value = redemption proceeds

**Denomination asset**

Specify the underlying collateral token:

- Enter the ERC20 contract address for the collateral token
- Common choices: USDC, USDT, or platform stablecoin
- Must be deployed ERC20 contract with decimals() function
- Validates address format and checks contract exists

![Bond-specific parameters](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Bond parameters showing maturity date picker, face value input, and denomination
asset address field with validation_

**Example configuration:**

- Face value: 1000
- Denomination asset: 0x...USDC (USDC stablecoin)
- Result: Each bond token redeems for 1,000 USDC at maturity

</Step>

<Step>

### 3. Configure yield distribution (optional)

You can enable scheduled interest/coupon calculations through the yield add-on.

**Note:** The yield module is an optional add-on. You must explicitly enable it
during bond creation. Bonds deployed without this add-on cannot support
scheduled coupon calculations and claim-based distributions.

#### Yield schedule setup

If you enabled the yield add-on, define your payment schedule:

1. **Enable yield** - Toggle yield distribution on
2. **Payment frequency** - Select from:
   - Quarterly (every 3 months)
   - Semi-annual (every 6 months)
   - Annual (every 12 months)
3. **First payment date** - Set initial distribution date
4. **Yield rate** - Annual percentage rate (entered as basis points)

![Yield schedule configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Yield configuration showing payment frequency dropdown, first
payment date picker, and yield rate input with basis points calculator_

**Yield rate examples:**

- 5% annual = 500 basis points
- 7.5% annual = 750 basis points
- 10% annual = 1000 basis points

#### Payment mechanism

The yield module automates coupon distribution calculations based on:

- **Bond terms** - Face value and interest rate you configured
- **Payment currency** - Denomination asset (USDC, USDT, stablecoins, etc.)
- **Holder proportions** - Automatic pro-rata calculation across all bondholders

When a payment date arrives:

1. The system captures who holds bonds at that moment
2. Calculates what each holder is owed based on their holdings
3. Token holders claim their interest payments directly through the investor
   portal
4. Each holder receives the correct proportion based on their bond holdings

**Funding requirement:** Ensure your designated payment wallet holds sufficient
funds before each payment date so bondholders can claim their interest. The
platform shows you exactly how much funding is required for upcoming payments.

<Callout type="info" title="Business context">
  Traditional bond administration requires collecting bondholder lists,
  calculating interest manually, coordinating hundreds or thousands of wire
  transfers, and reconciling which payments cleared. This process typically
  takes 5-10 business days and costs $50-200 per bondholder depending on
  transfer agent fees. ATK eliminates this operational overhead—bondholders
  claim their interest on-demand, and the system tracks everything
  automatically.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### 4. Set compliance rules

Your bond token enforces transfer restrictions through compliance modules.

#### Regulatory framework selection

Choose your applicable regulatory framework:

- **Regulation D** - US private placement (accredited investors only)
- **Regulation S** - Offshore offering (non-US investors)
- **Regulation A** - US public offering (broader investor base)
- **Custom** - Define custom compliance requirements

**Note:** Selecting a framework provides pre-configured compliance modules. You
can customize individual modules after deployment.

![Compliance framework selection](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Compliance framework cards showing Reg D, Reg S, Reg A, and Custom
options with descriptions_

#### Configure compliance modules

Based on your selected framework, configure these modules:

**Country restrictions**

Limit bond purchases by jurisdiction:

1. Enable **Country Allow List** module
2. Select permitted countries from list
3. Or enable **Country Block List** and select restricted countries

Regulation D typically restricts to US only; Regulation S excludes US.

**Investor eligibility**

Set OnchainID claim requirements:

- **Accredited investor** claim (required for Reg D)
- **KYC/AML verification** level (typically Level 2 or higher)
- **Qualified purchaser** status (for certain offerings)

Only addresses with all required claims can hold bonds.

**Transfer restrictions**

Configure additional limits:

- **Time Lock** - Enforce holding period (e.g., 12-month lock-up)
- **Transfer Limit** - Cap maximum transfer size
- **Supply Limit** - Set maximum bond issuance amount

![Compliance module configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Compliance modules showing Country Allow List, Identity
Verification, and Time Lock modules with configuration panels_

</Step>

<Step>

### 5. Assign operational roles

Grant permissions for bond management.

#### Role assignments

Assign wallet addresses to these operational roles:

**GOVERNANCE_ROLE**

Manages compliance and bond lifecycle:

- Set yield schedules
- Add/remove compliance modules
- Trigger bond maturation
- Configure identity requirements

Typically assigned to: Legal/compliance team wallet

**SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE**

Controls token supply:

- Mint new bonds (primary issuance)
- Burn bonds (cancellation)
- Batch mint operations

Typically assigned to: Treasury operations wallet

**CUSTODIAN_ROLE**

Handles recovery and freezing:

- Freeze compromised accounts
- Execute forced transfers
- Recover lost tokens

Typically assigned to: Custodian service wallet

**EMERGENCY_ROLE**

Emergency interventions:

- Pause all transfers
- Unpause after incident resolution

Typically assigned to: Security operations wallet

![Role assignment interface](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Role assignment form showing four roles with address inputs, descriptions, and
current assignments_

**Best practice:** Assign different wallet addresses to different roles for
separation of duties. Use multisig wallets for GOVERNANCE_ROLE and
EMERGENCY_ROLE.

</Step>

<Step>

### 6. Review and deploy

#### Pre-deployment checklist

Review your configuration summary:

- [ ] Token name and symbol correct
- [ ] Maturity date set correctly
- [ ] Face value matches term sheet
- [ ] Denomination asset address validated
- [ ] Yield schedule configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Compliance modules match regulatory framework
- [ ] All operational roles assigned to correct addresses
- [ ] Initial supply amount confirmed (or 0 if minting later)

![Deployment summary review](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:

with edit buttons_

#### Deploy bond contract

Execute your deployment:

1. Click **Deploy Bond Token**
2. Review the transaction details in the confirmation modal
3. Enter your PIN or OTP to authenticate
4. Confirm the transaction

Your deployment will:

1. Deploy the bond proxy contract (15-20 seconds)
2. Initialize with your parameters (10 seconds)
3. Assign roles to your specified addresses (5 seconds per role)
4. Register with the identity registry (10 seconds)

**Total deployment time:** 60-90 seconds

![Deployment progress](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Deployment progress modal showing checklist of deployment steps with status
indicators (pending/in progress/complete)_

</Step>

<Step>

### 7. Post-issuance actions

After your successful deployment:

#### Verify deployment

1. Note the contract address displayed
2. Click **View Bond Token** to navigate to token details page
3. Verify configuration on overview tab:
   - Token information matches parameters
   - Maturity date correct
   - Denomination asset linked
   - Roles assigned correctly

![Bond details overview](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Bond
token details page showing key information, maturity countdown, yield schedule,
and compliance status_

#### Mint initial allocation (if needed)

If you deployed with zero initial supply:

1. Navigate to **Actions** tab
2. Click **Mint Bonds**
3. Enter primary investor addresses and amounts
4. Click **Execute Batch Mint**

The contract validates each recipient's OnchainID and compliance status before
minting.

**Compliance check:** Minting fails if the recipient lacks required claims.
Verify investor OnchainIDs before attempting to mint.

#### Fund yield wallet

For bonds with the yield add-on enabled:

1. Note the yield wallet address shown on the **Yield** tab
2. Transfer sufficient denomination assets to yield wallet
3. Calculation: (total supply × face value × yield rate × periods) + buffer
4. Verify balance shows adequate funding for upcoming payments

**Funding timeline:** Fund your yield wallet at least 24 hours before the first
payment date.

#### Distribute offering documents

Link legal documentation to your token:

1. Navigate to the **Documents** tab
2. Click **Upload Offering Document**
3. Select your PDF file (offering memorandum, term sheet, etc.)
4. The platform generates a cryptographic hash and stores it on-chain
5. The document hash is displayed for verification

Your investors can verify document authenticity by comparing hashes.

</Step>

<Step>

### 8. Manage bond lifecycle

#### Monitor yield distributions

Track scheduled coupon calculations and claims:

1. Navigate to **Yield** tab on bond details page
2. Review upcoming payment schedule
3. Monitor past claims:
   - Payment date
   - Amount claimed
   - Claimants count
   - Transaction hashes

![Yield distribution history](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Yield tab showing upcoming payments schedule and historical distributions table
with dates, amounts, and status_

#### Process maturity

When your bond reaches maturity date:

1. Navigate to **Actions** tab
2. Click **Mature Bond** (available only after maturity date)
3. Review maturation details:
   - Total redemption amount required
   - Current denomination asset balance
4. Ensure redemption wallet holds sufficient assets
5. Click **Execute Maturation**

Maturation enables your token holders to redeem their bonds for denomination
assets.

#### Handle redemptions

After maturation, your investors can redeem:

**Investor redemption process:**

1. Investor navigates to their bond holdings
2. Clicks **Redeem Bonds**
3. Enters the amount to redeem
4. Receives denomination assets proportionally

**Your monitoring tasks:**

- Track redemptions on the **Holders** tab
- Monitor your denomination asset reserve balance
- Review redemption events on the **Events** tab

![Redemption tracking](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Bond
events tab showing redemption transactions with holder addresses, amounts
redeemed, and timestamps_

### Common workflows

**Increase bond supply:**

To issue additional bonds after initial deployment:

1. Prepare your new investor list with verified OnchainIDs
2. Navigate to **Actions** > **Mint Bonds**
3. Enter recipient addresses and amounts
4. Execute batch mint

**Compliance note:** All recipients must meet eligibility requirements;
non-compliant addresses cause transaction revert.

**Modify yield schedule:**

To change payment frequency or rate (requires GOVERNANCE_ROLE):

1. Navigate to the **Yield** tab
2. Click **Update Schedule**
3. Modify parameters (applies to new payments only; past payments are immutable)
4. Confirm changes

**Handle compromised investor account:**

If an investor reports a compromised wallet (requires CUSTODIAN_ROLE):

1. Navigate to **Participants** > **Entities**
2. Search for the investor address
3. Click **Actions** > **Freeze Account**
4. Initiate recovery to a new wallet:
   - Navigate to **Actions** > **Recover Tokens**
   - Enter the frozen address and new recovery address
   - Execute forced transfer
5. Unfreeze the new address

</Step>

</Steps>

## Results

After completing these steps, you will have:

- A deployed bond token contract with your specified parameters
- Configured compliance rules matching your regulatory framework
- Assigned operational roles to designated wallet addresses
- Minted initial bond allocations to verified investors
- (Optional) Funded yield wallet for scheduled coupon calculations
- Linked offering documents with on-chain hash verification

Your bond token is now live and can process transfers according to your
compliance rules. If you enabled the yield add-on, coupon entitlements will be
calculated automatically on your configured schedule, and token holders can
claim their coupons on-demand.

## Troubleshooting

**Deployment fails with "Invalid denomination asset":**

- Verify the address is a valid ERC20 contract
- Check the denomination asset has a `decimals()` function
- Ensure the denomination asset is not a proxy without proper interface

**Yield claiming reverts:**

- Check your yield wallet has sufficient denomination asset balance
- Verify the yield token address matches the denomination asset
- Ensure the claimant has a verified OnchainID

**Cannot mature bond:**

- Verify the current timestamp exceeds the maturity date
- Check your address has GOVERNANCE_ROLE
- Ensure the bond is not already matured

**Mint fails for specific recipient:**

- Verify the recipient's OnchainID is registered in the identity registry
- Check the recipient has all required claims (accredited status, KYC level,
  jurisdiction)
- Confirm the recipient is not on a blocklist

**Yield add-on not available after deployment:**

- The yield module must be enabled during bond creation
- You cannot add the yield module to existing bonds
- Redeploy with the yield add-on enabled if scheduled coupon calculations are
  required
