## Overview

This guide walks you through your first asset tokenization project from initial
login through token deployment. You'll set up your identity, configure system
settings, and issue your first compliant security token.

In about 30-45 minutes, you'll have a working token deployed and understand the
platform's core workflow.

**Primary role:** First-time platform users, asset issuers

**Secondary readers:** Financial operations teams, compliance officers

## Before you start

Make sure you have:

- Active platform account with access credentials
- Basic understanding of your asset type (bond, equity, fund, stablecoin, or
  deposit)
- Compliance requirements for your jurisdiction

**Time required:** 30-45 minutes for complete setup and first token issuance

## Step 1: Log in and access the platform

Navigate to your platform instance URL (provided by your administrator) and sign
in using your credentials.

After successful authentication, you'll land on the onboarding welcome screen if
this is your first login.

**Tip:** If you're having trouble logging in, check that JavaScript is enabled
and try clearing your browser cache.

## Step 2: Complete onboarding workflow

The platform guides you through a structured setup to ensure everything's
configured before you start issuing assets.

### Create your wallet

Your platform wallet manages cryptographic operations and holds your
administrative permissions.

1. Click **Create Wallet** on the welcome screen
2. Review the security information about your wallet
3. The platform generates your wallet automatically
4. Store your recovery codes securely (download or print)

**Security note:** Recovery codes are the only way to restore wallet access if
you lose your session. Store them securely offlineâ€”not in email or cloud
storage.

### Set up wallet security

Choose your authentication method for sensitive operations:

1. Choose between PIN code or OTP (one-time password) authentication
2. **PIN code** - Set a 6-digit PIN for quick local authentication
3. **OTP** - Scan QR code with authenticator app for enhanced security
4. Verify your chosen method before proceeding

Most users choose PIN for convenience. Choose OTP if regulatory requirements
mandate two-factor authentication.

### Deploy your OnchainID

Your OnchainID is your verifiable identity on the blockchain, required for
compliance.

1. Click **Create Identity** on the identity setup screen
2. The platform deploys your OnchainID contract (takes about 30 seconds)
3. Review your identity address once deployed
4. Proceed to system deployment

Your OnchainID is a smart contract that holds verifiable claims about your
identity and compliance status.

### Deploy system contracts

The platform deploys core system contracts for your organization:

- **Identity Registry** - Manages participant identities
- **Compliance modules** - Enforces transfer rules
- **Claim Topics and Issuers** - Verification framework
- **Token Factories** - Asset deployment infrastructure

This step runs automatically and takes 2-3 minutes. The platform displays
progress for each contract deployment.

### Select asset types

Choose which asset types your organization will issue:

- **Bonds** - Fixed-term debt instruments with maturity and yield
- **Equity** - Tokenized shares with voting rights
- **Funds** - Investment fund shares with management fees
- **Stablecoins** - Fiat-pegged tokens with collateral backing
- **Deposits** - Certificate of deposit tokens

Select at least one asset type to proceed. You can enable additional types later
through platform settings.

The platform deploys factory contracts for each selected asset type.

### Choose addon modules

Select optional functionality modules:

- **Yield** - Interest and dividend distribution (automatically selected if you
  chose Bonds)

**Note:** Additional addons can be deployed later from platform settings.

## Step 3: Navigate to asset creation

After onboarding completes, you're ready to create your first token.

1. Review your dashboard showing system overview
2. Navigate to **Asset Management** in the left sidebar
3. Select your desired asset type (for example, **Bonds** for debt instruments)
4. Click **Create New Token** to begin asset configuration

## Step 4: Configure asset details

The asset designer guides you through token configuration specific to your asset
type.

### Basic information

Required for all asset types:

- **Token name** - Full legal name (for example, "MidCorp 2027 Senior Notes")
- **Token symbol** - Trading symbol (for example, "MCORP27")
- **Decimals** - Precision (typically 18 for divisibility, 0 for whole shares)
- **Initial supply** - Number of tokens to mint at deployment (can be 0)

### Asset-specific settings

Each asset type requires additional configuration:

**For bonds:**

- Maturity date (timestamp when bond matures)
- Face value (redemption amount per token)
- Denomination asset (collateral token address)
- Yield schedule (payment frequency and rate)

**For equity:**

- Voting rights configuration (enabled/disabled)
- Shareholder class designation

**For funds:**

- Management fee (basis points)
- Fund manager address

**For stablecoins:**

- Peg currency (USD, EUR, etc.)
- Collateral requirements

**For deposits:**

- Certificate details
- Maturity terms (if applicable)

### Assign operational roles

Assign addresses to operational roles:

- **GOVERNANCE_ROLE** - Compliance configuration
- **SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE** - Mint and burn operations
- **CUSTODIAN_ROLE** - Account freezing and recovery
- **EMERGENCY_ROLE** - Pause functionality

**Tip:** Assign your admin wallet to all roles initially. You can delegate to
operational wallets later.

## Step 5: Configure compliance rules

Set transfer restrictions and eligibility requirements:

### Select compliance modules

Choose from available compliance modules:

- **Country Allow List** - Restrict transfers by jurisdiction
- **Identity Verification** - Require verified OnchainID
- **Time Lock** - Enforce holding periods
- **Supply Limit** - Cap total token supply
- **Transfer Limit** - Restrict transaction sizes

Configure parameters for each enabled module.

### Set claim requirements

Specify required OnchainID claims for token holders:

- Accredited investor status
- KYC/AML verification level
- Jurisdiction of residence
- Regulatory compliance attestations

Only addresses with all required claims can receive tokens.

## Step 6: Review and deploy

Review your asset configuration:

1. Verify all parameters in the summary view
2. Check role assignments
3. Confirm compliance settings
4. Review gas cost estimate
5. Click **Deploy Token**

Authenticate the deployment transaction:

1. Enter your PIN or OTP when prompted
2. Review transaction details
3. Confirm deployment

Deployment takes 30-60 seconds. The platform displays progress as contracts
deploy.

## Step 7: Post-deployment actions

After successful deployment, you're ready to use your token.

### View your token

1. Navigate to **Asset Management** &gt; **Your Asset Type**
2. Click your newly deployed token
3. Review the token details page showing:
   - Contract address
   - Current supply
   - Holder count
   - Compliance status
   - Recent events

### Mint initial supply (if needed)

If you deployed with zero initial supply:

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab on your token page
2. Click **Mint Tokens**
3. Enter recipient address and amount
4. Confirm transaction

The recipient must have a verified OnchainID with required claims.

### Configure yield schedule (bonds only)

For bond tokens with yield distributions:

1. Navigate to the **Yield** tab on your bond token page
2. Click **Configure Schedule**
3. Set payment frequency (quarterly, semi-annual, annual)
4. Set yield rate (annual percentage)
5. Specify yield token (denomination asset)
6. Save configuration

Yield distributions execute automatically based on your schedule.

## What you accomplished

You've now:

- Set up your wallet and identity
- Deployed core system contracts
- Created and deployed your first compliant token
- Configured compliance rules

## Next steps

## Troubleshooting

**OnchainID deployment fails**

- Check that your wallet has sufficient native token balance for gas
- Verify network connectivity
- Retry deployment after 30 seconds

**Token deployment reverts**

- Verify all required fields are filled
- Check that role addresses are valid Ethereum addresses
- Ensure denomination asset address (for bonds) is a deployed ERC20 contract

**Cannot mint tokens**

- Verify recipient has verified OnchainID
- Check recipient OnchainID has all required claims
- Ensure your wallet has SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE
