## Overview

This guide covers troubleshooting for token transfers, transaction failures, and
related issues. Learn how to diagnose and resolve problems with moving tokens
between addresses.

**Primary audience:** Token holders, investors **Related guides:**
[Compliance Troubleshooting](/docs/user-guides/troubleshooting/compliance),

## How to use this guide

1. **Identify the failure point** - Note when the transaction failed
   (submission, confirmation, etc.)
2. **Check error messages** - Review wallet and platform error messages
3. **Try diagnostic steps** - Follow solutions for your specific scenario
4. **Verify on blockchain** - Always check blockchain explorer for transaction
   status

**Tip:** Keep transaction hashes for all failed transactions when seeking
support.

## Transfer failures

### Token transfer fails or reverts

**Symptoms:** "Transfer failed" message, transaction reverts, or tokens not
arriving at destination.

**Solutions:**

1. **Compliance failures:**
   - **Recipient not verified:** Recipient must have verified OnchainID with
     required claims
   - **Transfer restrictions:** Token may have transfer limits or lock-up
     periods
   - **Blocked address:** Recipient may be on blocklist or sanctions list
   - **Country restrictions:** Recipient country may not be allowed

2. **Insufficient balance:**
   - Verify you hold sufficient token balance
   - Check you're transferring correct token
   - Account for gas costs in native token

3. **Gas issues:**
   - Transaction out of gas
   - Increase gas limit in wallet
   - Retry during lower network congestion

4. **Paused token:**
   - Token transfers may be paused by issuer
   - Check token status on token details page
   - Wait for unpause or contact issuer

**Diagnosis:** Check transaction on blockchain explorer for specific revert
reason.

**Next steps:** If error mentions "compliance" or "module check failed", see
[Compliance Troubleshooting](/docs/user-guides/troubleshooting/compliance).

### Cannot find recipient address or transfer form disabled

**Symptoms:** Transfer button greyed out or recipient address validation fails.

**Solutions:**

1. **Address format:**
   - Ensure recipient address is valid Ethereum address (0x... format)
   - Check address is complete (42 characters including 0x)
   - Verify checksum capitalization correct

2. **Transfer restrictions:**
   - Some tokens prohibit transfers (locked during lock-up period)
   - Check token settings for transferability
   - Contact issuer if transfers should be allowed

3. **Minimum transfer:**
   - Token may have minimum transfer amount
   - Increase transfer amount above minimum

**Workaround:** Use blockchain explorer to verify recipient address exists and
can receive tokens.

### Transfer succeeds but recipient balance not updated

**Symptoms:** Transaction confirmed but recipient doesn't see tokens.

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait for confirmations:**
   - Wait for 3-5 block confirmations
   - Refresh recipient's page
   - Check blockchain explorer for transaction

2. **Wrong network:**
   - Verify sender and recipient on same network
   - Cannot transfer between different chains
   - Use bridge if cross-chain transfer needed

3. **Platform sync delay:**
   - Platform may take few minutes to index transaction
   - Token balance correct on-chain (check explorer)
   - Platform UI updates shortly

**Verification:** Always verify transaction on blockchain explorer for ground
truth.

## Transaction submission issues

### Transaction pending forever

**Symptoms:** Transaction shows "Pending" status indefinitely.

**Solutions:**

1. **Low gas price:**
   - Transaction may be under-priced for current network
   - Use wallet's "Speed Up" feature to increase gas price
   - Wait for network congestion to decrease

2. **Nonce issues:**
   - Earlier transaction blocking this one
   - Check wallet for pending transactions with lower nonces
   - Cancel or speed up blocking transaction

3. **Network congestion:**
   - Network may be experiencing high load
   - Wait 15-30 minutes for processing
   - Check network status page for issues

**Escalation:** If pending &gt; 1 hour, contact support with transaction hash.

### Transaction fails immediately without being submitted

**Symptoms:** Error before wallet confirmation dialog appears.

**Solutions:**

1. **Simulation failure:**
   - Platform simulates transaction before submission
   - Check error message for specific issue
   - Common: insufficient balance, compliance failure

2. **Network connection:**
   - Check wallet and platform connected to network
   - Refresh page and retry
   - Verify internet connection stable

3. **Smart contract state:**
   - Contract may be paused or in maintenance
   - Check platform announcements
   - Wait and retry later

**Diagnosis:** Copy full error message for support if issue persists.

## Gas and fee issues

### "Insufficient gas" or "Out of gas"

**Symptoms:** Transaction fails with gas-related error.

**Solutions:**

1. **Insufficient native token:**
   - Ensure wallet has native tokens (ETH, MATIC, etc.) for gas
   - Check balance includes amount for gas fees
   - Add native tokens to wallet

2. **Gas limit too low:**
   - Increase gas limit in wallet
   - Platform typically sets appropriate limit, but manual increase may help
   - Try 10-20% higher than suggested

3. **Complex transaction:**
   - Some operations require more gas
   - Use "Fast" or "Aggressive" gas settings
   - Retry during lower network activity

**Prevention:** Keep small amount of native tokens in wallet for gas.

### Gas fees too high

**Symptoms:** Transaction requires unexpectedly high gas fees.

**Solutions:**

1. **Network congestion:**
   - Wait for off-peak hours
   - Check gas trackers (etherscan.io/gastracker)
   - Retry when base fee lower

2. **Complex compliance checks:**
   - First-time transfers may cost more due to storage
   - Subsequent transfers typically cheaper
   - Consider if transaction urgent or can wait

3. **Wrong gas settings:**
   - Wallet may be over-estimating
   - Manually adjust gas price in wallet
   - Use "Standard" instead of "Fast" if not urgent

**Note:** High gas is often network-wide, not platform-specific.

## Token approval issues

### "Insufficient allowance" error

**Symptoms:** Transaction fails with allowance-related error.

**Solutions:**

1. **Approve token spending:**
   - Navigate to token settings
   - Click **Approve** for platform contract
   - Set allowance amount (or use "unlimited")
   - Wait for approval transaction confirmation
   - Retry original transaction

2. **Approval expired or revoked:**
   - Previous approval may have been used up
   - Re-approve with higher allowance
   - Some tokens require zero approval before setting new allowance

3. **Wrong spender contract:**
   - Ensure approving correct contract address
   - Platform shows contract requiring approval
   - Verify contract address matches

**Security:** Only approve tokens for contracts you trust; consider limited
allowances for security.

### Approval transaction pending or failed

**Symptoms:** Cannot complete approval transaction.

**Solutions:**

1. **Gas issues:**
   - Approval requires gas like any transaction
   - Follow gas troubleshooting steps above
   - Retry with higher gas

2. **Token restrictions:**
   - Some tokens have approval restrictions
   - Check token supports ERC-20 approve function
   - Contact issuer if persistent

3. **Multiple approvals:**
   - Don't submit multiple approval transactions
   - Wait for first to confirm
   - Cancel pending approval before new attempt

## Error messages reference

### "Transaction would revert"

**Meaning:** Transaction simulation failed; execution would fail on-chain.

**Common causes:**

- Compliance checks failing
- Insufficient balance or allowance
- Invalid parameters
- Contract paused

**Solution:** Check specific error message in wallet for details; review
compliance requirements.

### "Transfer amount exceeds limit"

**Meaning:** Transaction violates configured transfer limits.

**Solution:**

- Reduce transfer amount below limit
- Wait for limit period to reset
- Contact issuer to increase limit

### "Nonce too low"

**Meaning:** Transaction nonce already used or incorrect.

**Solution:** Reset wallet account or wait for pending transactions to complete.

### "Insufficient balance"

**Meaning:** Wallet lacks sufficient tokens for transfer.

**Solution:** Verify token balance and ensure you're not trying to transfer more
than available.

### "Module check failed"

**Meaning:** Compliance module preventing transaction.

**Common causes:**

- Country restrictions
- Investor count limit reached
- Time lock enforced
- Supply limit exceeded

**Solution:** Review token compliance settings and resolve specific module
requirement. See
[Compliance Troubleshooting](/docs/user-guides/troubleshooting/compliance).

### "Token is paused"

**Meaning:** Token contract paused by administrator.

**Solution:** Wait for unpause announcement or contact token issuer.
