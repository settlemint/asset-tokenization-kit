  When token transfers fail, the issue typically occurs at one of three stages -
  submission, validation, or execution. This guide helps you diagnose where your
  transaction failed and resolve the root cause quickly. Use the blockchain
  operations dashboard to monitor transaction status in real-time, track gas
  usage, and review compliance validation results.

## Compliance-related failures

The most common reason for transfer failures is compliance validation. Security
tokens enforce regulatory requirements at the smart contract level, meaning
every transfer must pass compliance checks before execution.

### Recipient not verified

Transfers fail when the recipient lacks a verified OnchainID or is missing
required claims. This is by design—security tokens can only move to eligible,
verified addresses. Check the compliance metrics dashboard to see which specific
claims are required for this token.

To resolve this, the recipient must complete identity verification and obtain
the necessary claims from approved claim issuers. For institutional transfers,
coordinate with your compliance officer to ensure both parties meet eligibility
requirements before initiating the transfer.

### Transfer restrictions and limits

Tokens may enforce time-based restrictions (lock-up periods), amount limits
(maximum transfer size), or holder count limits (to comply with securities
regulations). These rules are configured by the token issuer and enforced
automatically by compliance modules.

If you encounter a "transfer amount exceeds limit" error, reduce the transfer
size or wait for the limit period to reset. The token details page shows current
restrictions, and the compliance dashboard displays your available transfer
capacity.

### Blocklist and country restrictions

Some tokens restrict transfers to or from specific jurisdictions or maintain
blocklists for regulatory compliance. When a transfer fails with "country
restrictions" or "blocked address," the recipient's jurisdiction or address
status prevents the transaction.

Contact the token issuer to understand the restriction policy. In many cases,
these restrictions are mandated by securities regulations and cannot be bypassed
without legal modifications to the token's compliance rules.

## Gas and fee estimation

Gas estimation failures often indicate deeper issues with the transaction
itself. When the platform cannot estimate gas, it usually means the transaction
would revert if submitted. However, sometimes network conditions or complex
compliance checks cause legitimate transactions to require more gas than
initially estimated.

### Insufficient native token for gas

Every blockchain transaction requires native tokens (ETH, MATIC, etc.) to pay
for execution. Security token transfers need gas even though you're moving a
different token. Keep a small reserve of native tokens in your wallet
specifically for transaction fees.

First-time transfers typically cost more gas because they initialize storage for
the new token holder relationship. Subsequent transfers to the same recipient
are cheaper. You can view historical gas costs in the blockchain operations
dashboard to predict future transaction expenses.

### Gas price and network congestion

During periods of high network activity, gas prices can spike dramatically. The
platform automatically adjusts gas estimates based on current network
conditions, but you can manually control gas settings in your wallet if
transactions are time-sensitive.

For non-urgent transfers, wait for off-peak hours when base fees are lower.
Monitor network gas prices using blockchain explorers before submitting large or
complex transactions. The observability dashboard shows average gas costs for
recent transactions to help you gauge appropriate timing.

### Complex compliance operations

Some compliance checks require more computational resources than others,
particularly when evaluating multiple modules or processing first-time holder
registrations. The platform accounts for this in gas estimates, but edge cases
may require manual gas limit increases.

If your transaction fails with "out of gas" despite using estimated values, try
increasing the gas limit by 20-30% in your wallet settings. This provides
additional headroom for complex compliance validation without significantly
affecting transaction costs if the extra gas isn't consumed.

## Transaction state issues

### Pending transactions

Transactions remain pending when they're submitted to the blockchain but not yet
included in a block. This is normal for a few minutes, but transactions stuck
pending for over an hour typically indicate under-pricing or nonce conflicts.

Modern wallets support transaction replacement, letting you "speed up" a pending
transaction by resubmitting with a higher gas price. This uses the same nonce,
replacing the original transaction. Alternatively, you can wait for network
congestion to clear, though this may take several hours during peak periods.

Check the blockchain operations dashboard for your pending transaction status
and current network conditions. If multiple transactions are pending, they must
complete in order due to nonce sequencing.

### Nonce conflicts

Each transaction from your wallet has a sequential nonce (number used once). If
an earlier transaction is pending or failed, subsequent transactions with higher
nonces won't execute until the earlier one completes. This creates a queue where
one stuck transaction blocks all following ones.

To resolve nonce conflicts, either speed up or cancel the blocking transaction.
Most wallets show pending transactions in order and offer built-in tools for
replacement. Avoid manually setting nonces unless you understand the
implications, as incorrect nonce values can create persistent issues.

### Transaction simulation vs execution differences

The platform simulates transactions before submission to catch errors early, but
blockchain state can change between simulation and execution. If someone else
transfers tokens, pauses the contract, or modifies compliance rules after your
simulation but before your transaction executes, you may see execution failures
despite successful simulation.

When this happens, the transaction reverts on-chain and you'll see the actual
error in the blockchain explorer. Simply retry the transaction—the platform will
simulate against current state and either succeed or show you the updated error
immediately.

## Common error messages

Understanding error messages helps you diagnose issues quickly. The table below
maps common errors to their causes and solutions.

## Token approval workflow

Many token operations require you to approve the platform's smart contracts to
spend tokens on your behalf. This is a standard security pattern in blockchain
applications—you grant explicit permission for contracts to move your tokens,
preventing unauthorized access.

Approval is a separate transaction that must complete before the main operation.
When you see "insufficient allowance" errors, you need to:

1. Navigate to the token settings or approval interface
2. Submit an approval transaction for the relevant contract
3. Wait for the approval transaction to confirm (usually 1-2 minutes)
4. Retry your original transaction

Some tokens require you to reset approval to zero before setting a new
allowance. If your approval transaction fails, check whether the token uses this
pattern and submit a zero-approval transaction first.

## Balance and confirmation issues

### Transfers complete but balances don't update

Blockchain transactions are asynchronous—they're submitted, validated, executed,
and then indexed by various systems. When you see a successful transaction but
unchanged balances, it's usually a timing issue with one of these stages.

First, verify the transaction completed on-chain using a blockchain explorer.
The explorer shows ground truth—if it shows a successful transfer, the tokens
have moved regardless of what UI displays. Platform interfaces rely on indexing
services that may lag a few minutes behind the blockchain.

Refresh your page after 2-3 block confirmations (typically 30-60 seconds). If
the transaction succeeded on-chain but the UI still shows old balances after 5
minutes, the indexing service may be delayed. Check the subgraph health metrics
in the observability dashboard to see if indexing is running normally.

### Wrong network or token

Blockchain networks are isolated—tokens on Ethereum cannot transfer to Polygon
addresses, even though both use the same address format. Similarly, tokens are
distinct contracts, and you must select the correct token when initiating
transfers.

Always verify you're connected to the correct network in your wallet before
signing transactions. The platform displays the expected network, and most
wallets will prompt you to switch if you're on the wrong one. If you need to
move assets between networks, use approved bridge services rather than direct
transfers.

### Transaction confirmed but reverted

A transaction can be included in a block (confirmed) but still fail during
execution (reverted). This happens when the transaction was properly formatted
and paid for gas, but the smart contract logic rejected the operation.

Reverted transactions consume gas but don't change state beyond the gas payment.
Check the blockchain explorer for the revert reason—it will show the specific
error that caused the failure. Common causes include compliance checks failing
between submission and execution, or concurrent transactions that changed state
unexpectedly.

## Preventive practices

Avoiding transaction failures starts with understanding the compliance
requirements and system state before initiating transfers. Verify that both
sender and recipient have the necessary identity verification and claims. Check
the token's current status to ensure it's not paused or restricted.

Maintain a reserve of native tokens for gas fees. Transaction failures due to
insufficient gas balance are entirely preventable with proper account
management. Keep enough for at least 10-20 transactions to handle retries and
gas price fluctuations.

Review transfer limits and compliance rules in the token details page before
large or time-sensitive transfers. First-time transfers to new recipients cost
more gas and may trigger additional compliance checks. Factor this into your
timing and gas budget.

Use the blockchain operations dashboard to monitor network conditions and
historical gas costs. This helps you choose optimal timing for transfers and set
appropriate gas parameters for reliable execution.

## Getting support

When you encounter persistent transaction issues that these troubleshooting
steps don't resolve, gather comprehensive information before contacting support:

- Transaction hash (even for failed transactions)
- Wallet address (sender)
- Recipient address
- Token contract address
- Complete error message text
- Screenshots from both wallet and platform
- Timestamp of transaction attempt

Verify the transaction status in a blockchain explorer and note whether it's
pending, failed, or successfully executed but showing incorrect results in the
UI. Include the revert reason if the explorer displays one.

Check the blockchain operations dashboard for any system-wide issues or
announcements that might explain the failure. Network issues, scheduled
maintenance, or known bugs may already have documented workarounds.

Response times vary by issue severity: missing tokens after successful
transactions typically receive responses within 1-2 business hours, while
general transaction failures are addressed within 4-8 hours.
