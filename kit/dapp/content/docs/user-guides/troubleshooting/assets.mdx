**Solutions:**

1. **Vesting period:**
   - Tokens may be subject to vesting schedule
   - Check subscription terms for vesting details
   - Navigate to **Account** &gt; **Vesting** to see schedule

   - Final compliance checks may be in progress
   - Issuer may be verifying all subscribers
   - Contact issuer if delay &gt; expected distribution date

**Verification:** Check transaction on blockchain explorer to confirm payment
token transfer succeeded.

## Bond and fixed income issues

### Bond yield or coupon payment not received

**Symptoms:** Expected payment not received on scheduled payment date.

**Solutions:**

1. **Eligibility check:**
   - Verify you held tokens on **record date** (not payment date)
   - Record date typically several days before payment date
   - Check **Distribution History** for your eligibility status
   - Tokens purchased after ex-date not eligible for current payment

2. **Distribution timing:**
   - Payment date does not mean instant payment
   - Distribution may process later on payment date
   - Check **Upcoming Distributions** for processing status
   - Allow 24 hours from payment date

3. **Distribution failed:**
   - Check your address has verified OnchainID
   - Ensure no compliance issues blocking transfer
   - Verify issuer funded distribution wallet
   - Check blockchain explorer for failed distribution transaction

4. **Unclaimed distribution:**
   - Some distributions require manual claim
   - Navigate to **Account** &gt; **Unclaimed** and claim payment
   - May have expiration period for claiming
   - Claim promptly to avoid forfeiture

**Verification:** Check blockchain explorer for distribution transaction to your
address; verify payment token balance increased.

### Cannot redeem bonds at maturity

**Symptoms:** Redemption button disabled or redemption transaction fails.

**Solutions:**

1. **Maturity not reached:**
   - Verify bond maturity date passed
   - Check current date vs. maturity date on bond details
   - Early redemption may not be allowed
   - Check for early redemption penalties or restrictions

2. **Redemption window:**
   - Bonds may have specific redemption window after maturity
   - Check bond prospectus for redemption terms
   - Submit redemption request within allowed window
   - Late redemption may have different process

3. **Insufficient liquidity:**
   - Bond issuer may lack reserves for redemption
   - Redemption queued for processing when funds available
   - Contact issuer for redemption timeline
   - Check issuer announcements for liquidity updates

4. **Compliance requirements:**
   - Redemption requires same compliance as transfers
   - Verify OnchainID verified and claims current
   - Check no freeze or restrictions on account
   - Ensure receiving address eligible

**Note:** Redemption returns principal plus any final coupon payment; verify
both amounts received.

## Fund issues

### Cannot redeem fund units

**Symptoms:** Redemption button disabled, unavailable, or redemption request
fails.

**Solutions:**

1. **Redemption schedule:**
   - Funds typically have specific redemption windows (monthly, quarterly)
   - Check fund prospectus for redemption schedule
   - Submit redemption **request** during submission window
   - Actual redemption executes later on redemption date

2. **Redemption request vs. execution:**
   - **Request window:** Period to submit redemption requests
   - **Redemption date:** Date when redemption executes and payment made
   - Note the difference; requests typically submitted days/weeks before
     execution

3. **Lock-up period:**
   - Fund may have minimum holding period
   - Check if you've held units for required duration
   - Early redemption may incur penalties
   - Verify lock-up period in fund terms

4. **NAV calculation:**
   - Redemption price based on Net Asset Value (NAV)
   - NAV calculated on redemption date
   - Price not known when submitting request
   - Check fund details for NAV calculation frequency

5. **Minimum holding requirement:**
   - Some funds require minimum remaining balance
   - Cannot redeem if it leaves balance below minimum
   - Redeem all units instead of partial redemption
   - Contact fund manager for exceptions

**Tip:** Plan redemptions well in advance due to request windows and execution
delays.

### Fund NAV not updating or incorrect

**Symptoms:** Net Asset Value shows stale or unexpected value.

**Solutions:**

1. **NAV calculation frequency:**
   - NAV typically updated daily, weekly, or monthly
   - Check fund details for calculation schedule
   - Off-schedule days may show previous NAV
   - Market closures affect calculation timing

2. **Oracle delays:**
   - NAV relies on price oracles for underlying assets
   - Oracle updates may be delayed
   - Wait for next scheduled update
   - Check oracle status if persistent

3. **Display issue:**
   - Refresh page to get latest NAV
   - Clear browser cache
   - Verify on blockchain or fund manager site

**Verification:** Compare platform NAV with fund manager's official NAV
publication.

## Governance and voting issues

### Voting transaction fails or vote not counted

**Symptoms:** Cannot submit vote on governance proposal or vote not reflected in
tally.

**Solutions:**

1. **Voting eligibility:**
   - Must hold tokens at **proposal creation block** (snapshot)
   - Tokens acquired after proposal created have zero voting power
   - Check **Voting Power** on proposal page
   - Cannot retroactively gain voting power for active proposal

2. **Already voted:**
   - Can only vote once per proposal
   - Cannot change vote after submission
   - Check **Your Vote** section on proposal page
   - Vote immutable once submitted

3. **Proposal status:**
   - Voting period may have ended
   - Check proposal status: Active, Passed, Failed, Cancelled
   - Cannot vote on closed proposals
   - Verify proposal end time and current time

4. **Voting power delegation:**
   - If you delegated votes, you cannot vote directly
   - Delegate votes on your behalf
   - Check **Delegation** status on governance page
   - Undelegate to vote yourself (only affects future proposals)

**Note:** Delegation changes only apply to proposals created after delegation
transaction.

### Delegation not working or delegate cannot vote

**Symptoms:** Delegated voting power not showing for delegate.

**Solutions:**

1. **Delegation timing:**
   - Delegation only applies to proposals created after delegation transaction
   - Existing proposals use snapshot before delegation
   - Wait for new proposals to see delegation effect

2. **Self-delegation:**
   - By default, voting power self-delegated
   - Explicit delegation to another address overrides this
   - Verify delegation transaction confirmed

3. **Delegate address:**
   - Ensure correct delegate address used
   - Typo in address delegates to wrong party
   - Check delegation status on governance page

4. **Undelegate process:**
   - To vote yourself, undelegate (re-delegate to self)
   - Submit undelegate transaction
   - Wait for confirmation
   - Only affects future proposals

**Verification:** Check governance page for current delegation status and voting
power distribution.

## Dividend and distribution issues

### Dividend not received or amount incorrect

**Symptoms:** Expected dividend payment missing or lower than expected.

**Solutions:**

1. **Eligibility verification:**
   - Check you held shares on **record date**
   - Purchased after ex-dividend date not eligible
   - Review **Distribution History** for eligibility
   - Verify holding quantity on record date

2. **Distribution calculation:**
   - Dividend per share × shares held on record date
   - Partial period ownership may result in proportional payment
   - Check distribution announcement for per-share amount
   - Verify your calculation matches

3. **Tax withholding:**
   - Some jurisdictions withhold taxes from dividends
   - Net payment lower than gross dividend
   - Check distribution details for withholding information
   - Contact issuer for tax documentation

4. **Claim requirement:**
   - Some dividends require manual claim
   - Check **Account** &gt; **Unclaimed Distributions**
   - Claim within expiration period
   - Unclaimed dividends may be forfeited after deadline

**Verification:** Check blockchain explorer for dividend transaction; verify
token increase in your wallet.
