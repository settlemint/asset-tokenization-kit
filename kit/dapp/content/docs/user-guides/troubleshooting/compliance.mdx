## KYC verification issues

### KYC verification rejected

**Symptoms:** KYC status shows "Rejected" with reason provided.

**Common rejection reasons and solutions:**

1. **Document quality issues:**
   - **Blurry or unclear image:** Take new photo in good lighting, ensure text
     readable
   - **Document cropped:** Capture entire document with all edges visible
   - **Glare or shadows:** Use indirect lighting, avoid flash
   - **Black and white copy:** Submit color scan or photo

2. **Document validity:**
   - **Expired document:** Submit current, valid document (check expiration
     date)
   - **Unsupported document type:** Use passport, national ID, or driver's
     license
   - **Document from unsupported country:** Check platform's supported
     jurisdictions

3. **Information mismatch:**
   - **Name spelling different:** Ensure name matches exactly across all
     documents
   - **Address mismatch:** Proof of address must match profile information
   - **Date of birth discrepancy:** Verify DOB entered correctly in profile

4. **Selfie verification failed:**
   - **Face not clearly visible:** Remove glasses, hats; ensure face well-lit
   - **Face doesn't match document:** Submit selfie with same appearance as ID
     photo
   - **Multiple faces detected:** Ensure only you in photo

**Resolution:** Review rejection reason, correct the issue, and resubmit KYC
with updated documents.

### KYC stuck in pending status

**Symptoms:** KYC status remains "Pending" for extended period (more than 3
business days).

**Solutions:**

1. **Normal processing time:**
   - Manual review typically 1-3 business days
   - Complex cases may take longer
   - Check during business hours for updates

2. **Additional information requested:**
   - Check email for requests from compliance team
   - Look for notifications in platform
   - Respond promptly to information requests

3. **Processing delays:**
   - High volume may cause delays
   - Holiday periods extend processing time
   - Contact compliance team if &gt; 5 business days

**Status check:** Navigate to **Account** &gt; **Identity** &gt; **KYC Status**
for current state and messages.

### Document upload fails

**Symptoms:** Cannot upload documents or upload hangs indefinitely.

**Solutions:**

1. **File requirements:**
   - File size must be &lt; 10 MB
   - Supported formats: PDF, JPG, PNG
   - Avoid HEIC/HEIF formats (convert to JPG first)

2. **Browser issues:**
   - Try different browser (Chrome, Firefox)
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Disable browser extensions temporarily

3. **Network problems:**
   - Check internet connection stable
   - Try smaller file size (compress image)
   - Avoid uploading on slow/mobile networks

**Workaround:** If persistent, contact compliance team via email to submit
documents directly.

## Claims management

### Cannot issue or receive claims

**Symptoms:** "Claim issuance failed" or claims not appearing on OnchainID.

**Solutions:**

1. **OnchainID not deployed:**
   - Verify OnchainID contract address exists
   - Deploy OnchainID if missing: **Account** &gt; **OnchainID** &gt; **Create**
   - Wait for deployment confirmation before receiving claims

2. **Claim issuer permissions:**
   - Only trusted claim issuers can issue claims
   - Verify issuer address registered in identity registry
   - Contact platform administrator to add claim issuer

3. **Invalid claim data:**
   - Claim data format incorrect (must follow schema)
   - Claim topic not registered in registry
   - Expiration date invalid (must be future date)

4. **Transaction failure:**
   - Check transaction on explorer for revert reason
   - Insufficient gas for claim issuance
   - Retry with higher gas limit

**Verification:** Check OnchainID on blockchain explorer to verify claims stored
correctly.

### Claim expired and cannot transfer tokens

**Symptoms:** "Transfer blocked: missing required claims" despite previously
having access.

**Solutions:**

1. **Identify expired claims:**
   - Navigate to **Account** &gt; **Identity** &gt; **Claims**
   - Check expiration dates on all claims
   - Note which claims expired or expiring soon

2. **Renew expired claims:**
   - Submit updated documentation to compliance officer
   - Request claim renewal through platform
   - Wait for new claim issuance

**Common claims requiring renewal:**

- **Accredited investor status:** Annually or when financial situation changes
- **KYC verification:** Periodically (every 12-24 months typically)
- **Jurisdiction/residency:** When moving to different country
- **Sanctions screening:** Periodic re-verification

3. **Temporary workaround:**
   - Cannot transfer until claim renewed
   - Receiving tokens may still work (depending on compliance rules)
   - Prioritize claim renewal for full access

**Prevention:** Set calendar reminders 30 days before claim expiration dates.

### Wrong claims or incorrect information

**Symptoms:** Claim contains incorrect data (wrong country, investor type,
etc.).

**Solutions:**

1. **Update profile information:**
   - Correct information in **Account** &gt; **Profile**
   - Submit supporting documentation for changes
   - Request claim reissuance with correct data

2. **Revoke incorrect claim:**
   - Contact claim issuer to revoke incorrect claim
   - Cannot self-revoke claims
   - Wait for revocation confirmation

3. **Issue corrected claim:**
   - After revocation, request new claim with correct data
   - Provide updated documentation
   - Verify new claim data before accepting

**CRITICAL:** Do not attempt transfers with incorrect claims as they may fail
compliance checks.

## Identity-related transaction failures

### "Identity not verified" error

**Symptoms:** Transaction fails with identity verification error.

**Meaning:** Sender or recipient lacks verified OnchainID with required claims.

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify you have OnchainID:**

   - Wait for deployment confirmation

2. **Complete KYC:**
   - Submit KYC documents if not yet verified
   - Wait for KYC approval
   - Obtain required compliance claims

3. **Verify recipient:**

   - Contact recipient to complete verification

**Next step:** After all parties verified, retry transaction.

### "Account frozen" error

**Meaning:** Your account or address frozen by compliance officer or
administrator.

   - Regulatory requirement
   - Outstanding compliance requirements

3. **Resolution process:**
   - Provide requested documentation
   - Resolve compliance issues
   - Wait for compliance officer to unfreeze
   - Verify unfreeze before attempting transactions

**CRITICAL:** Do not create new account or transfer assets through other means;
resolve freeze properly.

### "Country restricted" error

**Symptoms:** Transaction fails with jurisdiction or country restriction
message.

**Meaning:** Token has geographic restrictions and your jurisdiction not
allowed.

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify your jurisdiction claim:**
   - Check **Account** &gt; **Identity** &gt; **Claims**
   - Look for country/jurisdiction claim
   - Ensure claim data correct

2. **Token restrictions:**
   - Token may not be available in your country
   - Check token prospectus for eligible jurisdictions
   - Contact issuer if you believe eligible

3. **Changed residence:**
   - If recently moved countries, update profile
   - Submit proof of new address
   - Request updated jurisdiction claim
   - Verify new country is eligible for token

**Note:** Some tokens cannot be held by residents of certain countries due to
regulations.

## Error messages reference

### "Missing required claim"

**Meaning:** Transaction requires specific claim you don't have.

**Solution:**

1. Check error message for required claim topic (e.g., topic 1 = KYC)
2. Navigate to **Account** &gt; **Eligible Assets** to see requirements
3. Contact compliance officer to obtain missing claim

### "Claim expired"

**Meaning:** Required claim expired and no longer valid.

**Solution:** Request claim renewal from compliance officer with updated
documentation.
