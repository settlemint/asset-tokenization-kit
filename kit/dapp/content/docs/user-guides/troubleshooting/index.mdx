  ATK's observability stack surfaces issues before they impact users, giving you
  diagnostic dashboards, real-time metrics, and structured logs to resolve
  problems at every layer—from wallet connections to DALP lifecycle operations
  like DvP settlement and yield distribution.

## Troubleshooting philosophy

ATK treats observability as a first-class feature, not an afterthought. Every
component emits structured metrics and logs that flow into centralized
dashboards deployed via Helm charts. When something breaks, you start with the
metrics—transaction latency spikes, compliance rule rejections, vault balance
mismatches—and drill down from there. This proactive approach means you often
catch problems before users report them.

The troubleshooting guides below mirror the platform's architecture:
wallet/identity issues live at the user layer, transaction failures happen in
the smart contract and settlement layer, compliance blocks stem from the
identity registry and rule engine, and asset management problems touch the DALP
lifecycle features (DvP, vaults, yield distribution). Each guide links to
specific observability dashboards and metrics that help you diagnose root causes
fast.

## Diagnostic flow

When a user reports an issue or an alert fires, follow this flow to triage and
resolve:

Start at the observability layer to narrow the scope, then jump to the relevant
troubleshooting guide. If metrics confirm the fix, you're done; if not, escalate
with structured logs and dashboard screenshots attached.

## Observability dashboards for diagnostics

Each troubleshooting category maps to dashboards and metrics that surface the
most common root causes. Reference these starting points before diving into
detailed guides:

**Wallet issues**

- **Wallet connection dashboard**: Tracks connection success rate,
  MetaMask/WalletConnect failures, and RPC endpoint health
- **Signature failure metrics**: Counts rejected signatures, timeout events, and
  nonce mismatches
- Check the wallet troubleshooting guide when connection rates drop below 95% or
  signature failures spike

**Transaction failures**

- **Transaction latency dashboard**: Shows settlement times, pending TX queue
  depth, and gas price trends
- **Revert reason logs**: Structured logs capture revert messages with function
  signatures and parameters
- Use the transaction troubleshooting guide when latency exceeds 10s or revert
  rates climb above 2%

**Compliance blocks**

- **Compliance rule evaluation panel**: Real-time stats on KYC/AML checks,
  jurisdiction filters, and transfer restrictions
- **OnchainID registry metrics**: Tracks verification success rates, claim
  issuance, and identity updates
- Jump to the compliance troubleshooting guide when rule rejection rates spike
  or identity verification fails

**Asset management**

- **DALP lifecycle metrics**: Monitors DvP settlement completion, vault balance
  reconciliation, and yield distribution events
- **Supply and distribution panel**: Tracks token supply changes, mint/burn
  events, and holder balance deltas
- Open the asset troubleshooting guide for supply mismatches, vault balance
  drift, or yield calculation errors

## Troubleshooting guides by category

### Wallet issues

[Wallet troubleshooting guide](/docs/user-guides/troubleshooting/wallet) covers
wallet connection failures, signing problems, and permission errors. Common
scenarios: MetaMask stuck on "Connecting," rejected signatures during DvP
settlement, or insufficient permissions for vault withdrawals. The guide walks
through RPC endpoint validation, browser extension conflicts, and nonce resets,
with observability checkpoints at each step.

### Transaction failures

[Transaction troubleshooting guide](/docs/user-guides/troubleshooting/transactions)
addresses failed transfers, settlement errors, and gas-related problems. You'll
diagnose reverts from compliance rules, insufficient gas estimates for complex
DvP operations, and front-running issues during high-traffic periods. Dashboards
show you exactly which function reverted and why, saving hours of manual log
parsing.

### Compliance blocks

[Compliance troubleshooting guide](/docs/user-guides/troubleshooting/compliance)
handles OnchainID verification failures, KYC/AML rule rejections, and
jurisdictional restrictions. Users often hit these when attempting cross-border
transfers or when identity claims expire. The guide explains how to read
compliance rule evaluation logs, refresh OnchainID claims, and adjust transfer
restrictions for legitimate edge cases.

### Asset management

[Asset troubleshooting guide](/docs/user-guides/troubleshooting/assets) resolves
supply mismatches, distribution errors, and reconciliation problems across DALP
lifecycle operations. This includes vault balance drift after DvP settlement,
yield distribution amounts that don't match expectations, and supply cap
enforcement failures. Observability metrics surface these issues
immediately—often before users notice.

## Escalation path

If the troubleshooting guides and observability dashboards don't resolve the
issue, escalate to SettleMint support with this information:

- Dashboard screenshots showing abnormal metrics (with timestamps)
- Structured log excerpts (transaction hashes, revert reasons, error codes)
- Steps to reproduce, including user role, asset type, and specific operation
- Expected vs. actual behavior, with reference to DALP lifecycle features if
  applicable

For broader operational guidance beyond troubleshooting—like adjusting admin
settings, configuring new asset types, or optimizing gas usage—cross-reference
the [Operations guides](/docs/user-guides/operations/admin-settings).
