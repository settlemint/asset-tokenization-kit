---

Fund tokens represent ownership units in investment funds with net asset value
(NAV) tracking, management fees, and subscription/redemption workflows. This
guide walks you through deploying compliant fund tokens from configuration
through operational management.

**Who should read this:** Fund administrators, asset managers, investment
operations teams, and financial product managers tokenizing mutual funds, hedge
funds, or private equity funds.

**Time required:** 15-20 minutes for fund deployment; additional time for NAV
and fee configuration.

**Prerequisites:**

- Completed [Getting started](/docs/user-guides/getting-started) onboarding
- Fund system factory deployed during onboarding
- Fund prospectus and investment terms prepared
- Regulatory framework determined (40 Act, UCITS, AIFMD, or custom)

## Step 1: Navigate to fund creation

From the main dashboard:

1. Click **Asset Management** in the left sidebar
2. Select **Funds** from the asset type list
3. Click **Create New Fund Token** button

![Fund creation navigation](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Asset Management section showing Funds category with existing funds list and
Create New Fund Token button_

## Step 2: Configure fund parameters

### Basic token information

Enter standard token details:

- **Token name** - Full legal name (e.g., "Global Growth Fund Class A Shares")
- **Token symbol** - Trading symbol (e.g., "GGFA")
- **Decimals** - Token divisibility (18 for fractional units, 0 for whole units)
- **Initial supply** - Number of units to mint at deployment (typically 0 for
  funds)

![Fund basic information](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Fund
configuration form showing name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply fields
with validation_

**Naming guidance:** Include fund name and share class (Class A/B/C,
institutional/retail) for clear identification.

### Fund-specific parameters

Configure investment fund properties:

**Fund type**

Select fund structure:

- **Open-end fund** - Continuous subscription and redemption (mutual funds)
- **Closed-end fund** - Fixed capitalization with secondary market trading
- **Interval fund** - Periodic redemption windows

**Share class configuration**

Define class characteristics:

- **Management fee** - Annual fee percentage (entered as basis points)
- **Performance fee** - Carried interest or incentive fee (if applicable)
- **Minimum investment** - Minimum initial subscription amount
- **Redemption notice period** - Days notice required for redemption requests

![Fund type and class configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Fund parameters showing fund type dropdown, management fee input,
performance fee toggle, and minimum investment field_

**Management fee examples:**

- 1% annual = 100 basis points
- 1.5% annual = 150 basis points
- 2% annual = 200 basis points

### NAV tracking setup

Configure net asset value management:

**NAV calculation**

- **Initial NAV** - Starting NAV per unit (typically 100.00 or 1,000.00)
- **NAV currency** - Denomination currency (USD, EUR, etc.)
- **Valuation frequency** - Daily, weekly, or monthly NAV updates

**NAV oracle**

Link to price feed source:

1. **Manual NAV updates** - Administrator posts NAV values
2. **Oracle integration** - Automated NAV from external data provider
3. **Hybrid** - Oracle with administrator override capability

![NAV configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: NAV
settings showing initial NAV input, currency selector, valuation frequency
dropdown, and oracle integration options_

The platform uses NAV for subscription/redemption pricing calculations.

## Step 3: Configure subscription and redemption

Fund units require special issuance and withdrawal workflows.

### Subscription settings

Define how investors purchase fund units:

**Subscription process**

- **Minimum initial investment** - First purchase minimum (e.g., $10,000)
- **Minimum subsequent investment** - Additional purchase minimum (e.g., $1,000)
- **Subscription settlement** - T+0, T+1, T+2, T+3 settlement cycle
- **Cut-off time** - Daily deadline for subscription orders

**Payment methods**

Configure accepted payment tokens:

- Add stablecoin addresses (USDC, USDT, etc.)
- Set payment token conversion rates to NAV currency
- Enable multi-currency subscriptions (optional)

![Subscription configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Subscription settings showing minimum investment amounts, settlement cycle
selector, cut-off time picker, and payment token list_

### Redemption settings

Configure how investors exit the fund:

**Redemption process**

- **Redemption notice period** - Days advance notice required (e.g., 5 business
  days)
- **Redemption frequency** - Daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly redemptions
- **Redemption fee** - Early redemption penalty (if applicable, in basis points)
- **Redemption settlement** - T+1, T+3, T+5, T+7 settlement cycle

**Redemption restrictions**

Set withdrawal limits:

- **Minimum redemption** - Minimum withdrawal amount
- **Partial redemption minimum** - Minimum balance remaining after partial
  redemption
- **Gates** - Maximum percentage of fund redeemable per period (e.g., 25%
  quarterly)
- **Lock-up period** - Mandatory holding period before first redemption allowed

![Redemption configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Redemption settings showing notice period, frequency, fees, settlement cycle,
and restriction inputs_

**Hedge fund example:** 90-day lock-up, quarterly redemptions with 45-day
notice, 25% quarterly gate.

## Step 4: Set compliance rules

Fund tokens enforce investor eligibility and transfer restrictions.

### Regulatory framework selection

Choose applicable regulatory framework:

- **1940 Act** - US registered investment company
- **Regulation D** - US private fund (accredited/qualified purchasers)
- **UCITS** - European harmonized fund
- **AIFMD** - Alternative investment fund (EU)
- **Custom** - Jurisdiction-specific compliance

The platform pre-configures compliance modules for selected framework.

![Compliance framework selection](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Regulatory framework cards showing 1940 Act, Reg D, UCITS, AIFMD,
and Custom options with investor eligibility summaries_

### Configure compliance modules

Based on selected framework, configure modules:

**Investor eligibility**

Set OnchainID claim requirements:

- **Accredited investor** status (Reg D private funds)
- **Qualified purchaser** status (3(c)(7) funds)
- **Professional investor** status (AIFMD)
- **Suitability assessment** completion
- **KYC/AML verification** level

Only addresses with all required claims can subscribe to fund units.

**Transfer restrictions**

Configure secondary transfer rules:

- **Transferability** - Enable/disable secondary market transfers
- **Transfer approval** - Require fund manager approval for all transfers
- **Lock-up enforcement** - Prevent transfers during lock-up period
- **Maximum holders** - Cap total investor count (e.g., 99 for 3(c)(1) funds)

![Compliance module configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Compliance modules showing Investor Eligibility, Transfer
Restrictions, and Lock-up Period panels with configuration options_

**3(c)(1) vs 3(c)(7):** 3(c)(1) allows up to 99 investors (accredited required);
3(c)(7) allows unlimited qualified purchasers.

### Geographic restrictions

Limit fund access by jurisdiction:

1. Enable **Country Allow List** module
2. Select permitted investor countries
3. Configure distribution restrictions per UCITS/AIFMD passporting rules

## Step 5: Assign operational roles

Grant permissions for fund management:

### Role assignments

Assign addresses to fund-specific roles:

**GOVERNANCE_ROLE**

Manages fund compliance and operations:

- Configure compliance modules
- Update investor eligibility requirements
- Approve/reject subscription requests
- Configure redemption parameters
- Post NAV updates

Typically assigned to: Fund administrator or compliance officer wallet

**SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE**

Controls fund unit supply:

- Mint units (process subscriptions)
- Burn units (process redemptions)
- Execute NAV-based issuance calculations

Typically assigned to: Fund operations or treasury wallet

**CUSTODIAN_ROLE**

Handles investor account operations:

- Freeze compromised accounts
- Execute forced transfers (regulatory orders)
- Recover lost units

Typically assigned to: Fund custodian or transfer agent wallet

**EMERGENCY_ROLE**

Emergency interventions:

and timestamps_

## Step 7: Post-issuance actions

After successful deployment:

### Verify deployment

1. Note the contract address
2. Click **View Fund Token** to navigate to details page
3. Verify configuration:
   - Token information correct
   - Management fee rate matches
   - NAV tracking enabled
   - Roles assigned correctly

![Fund details overview](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Fund
token details page showing key metrics, NAV information, fee schedule, AUM, and
investor count_

### Set initial NAV

Post the first net asset value:

1. Navigate to **NAV** tab
2. Click **Update NAV**
3. Enter NAV per unit (typically your configured initial NAV)
4. Enter effective date and time
5. Confirm update

The NAV appears on fund details page and is used for subscription/redemption
calculations.

### Configure fee collection

Set up management fee collection:

1. Navigate to **Fees** tab
2. Review fee schedule showing management fee percentage
3. Configure fee collection wallet address
4. Set fee collection frequency (monthly, quarterly, annually)
5. Enable automated fee collection (optional)

**Fee calculation:** Management fees accrue daily based on AUM and collect
periodically by minting new units to fee wallet.

### Enable subscriptions

Open fund for investor subscriptions:

1. Navigate to **Settings** tab
2. Toggle **Accept Subscriptions** to enabled
3. Confirm subscription parameters correct
4. Review payment token addresses
5. Save changes

Investors can now submit subscription requests.

## Step 8: Manage fund operations

### Process subscription requests

Handle investor purchase orders:

**Subscription workflow:**

1. Investor submits subscription request via dApp:
   - Enters investment amount
   - Selects payment token
   - Transfers payment to fund subscription wallet
2. Request appears in **Subscriptions** queue
3. Navigate to **Subscriptions** &gt; **Pending**
4. Review request details:
   - Investor identity and compliance status
   - Investment amount and payment token
   - Applicable NAV (based on cut-off time)
   - Unit quantity calculation
5. Click **Approve** or **Reject**

**Approval actions:**

- Platform calculates units: investment amount / NAV per unit
- Mints calculated units to investor address
- Records subscription in fund ledger
- Updates total AUM

![Subscription queue](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Subscription requests table showing pending orders with investor, amount,
payment token, NAV, calculated units, and approve/reject buttons_

**Cut-off time handling:** Requests received before cut-off use same-day NAV;
requests after cut-off use next-day NAV.

### Update net asset value

Maintain accurate fund pricing:

**Manual NAV posting:**

1. Calculate fund NAV:
   - Sum all portfolio asset values
   - Subtract liabilities and accrued fees
   - Divide by total outstanding units
2. Navigate to **NAV** &gt; **Update NAV**
3. Enter new NAV per unit
4. Enter effective date/time
5. Provide calculation source/notes
6. Confirm update

**NAV validation:** Platform prevents NAV updates that deviate more than
configurable threshold (e.g., 10%) from previous NAV without additional
confirmation.

**Oracle integration:**

For automated NAV updates:

1. Configure oracle data feed
2. Set update frequency
3. Enable automated posting
4. Monitor oracle health on **NAV** tab

Platform posts NAV automatically based on oracle data.

![NAV update interface](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: NAV
update form showing NAV per unit input, effective date/time, calculation notes,
and historical NAV chart_

### Process redemption requests

Handle investor withdrawal orders:

**Redemption workflow:**

1. Investor submits redemption request via dApp:
   - Enters unit quantity to redeem
   - Selects payout token
   - Confirms redemption notice period
2. Request enters **Redemptions** &gt; **Pending Notice** queue
3. After notice period expires, request moves to **Ready for Processing**
4. Navigate to **Redemptions** &gt; **Ready**
5. Review request details:
   - Investor address
   - Unit quantity
   - Applicable NAV
   - Redemption proceeds calculation
   - Payout token
6. Ensure fund liquidity wallet has sufficient payout tokens
7. Click **Process Redemption**

**Processing actions:**

- Platform calculates proceeds: units × NAV per unit
- Burns redeemed units from investor address
- Transfers payout tokens from fund liquidity wallet to investor
- Records redemption in fund ledger
- Updates total AUM

![Redemption queue](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Redemption
requests showing notice period countdown, ready requests with investor, units,
NAV, proceeds, and process button_

**Gate enforcement:** If redemption requests exceed quarterly gate (e.g., 25%),
platform pro-rates all requests or queues excess for next period.

### Collect management fees

Execute fee collection:

**Automated fee collection:**

If enabled, platform automatically:

1. Calculates accrued fees daily: (AUM × fee rate) / 365
2. On collection date, mints new units to fee wallet
3. Unit quantity: total accrued fees / current NAV
4. Records fee event in fund history

**Manual fee collection:**

1. Navigate to **Fees** tab
2. Review accrued fees amount
3. Click **Collect Fees**
4. Confirm fee calculation
5. Execute collection

Fee collection dilutes existing investors proportionally.

**Performance fee calculation:**

For funds with performance fees:

1. Calculate high water mark
2. Determine fund performance above benchmark
3. Calculate performance fee: outperformance × performance fee rate
4. Mint units to manager fee wallet
5. Update high water mark

### Manage fund liquidity

Monitor redemption reserve:

1. Navigate to **Liquidity** tab
2. Review liquidity metrics:
   - Total redemption requests pending
   - Required liquidity for upcoming redemptions
   - Current cash/stablecoin reserves
   - Portfolio liquidity composition
3. Ensure sufficient reserves before redemption settlement dates

**Best practice:** Maintain liquidity buffer of 10-20% of AUM for redemption
capacity.

## Common workflows

### Handle new investor onboarding

Add new fund investor:

1. Investor completes KYC via platform or integrated provider
2. Investor's OnchainID receives required claims (accredited status, suitability
   assessment)
3. Verify investor appears in **Eligible Investors** list
4. Investor submits subscription request
5. Process subscription per workflow above

### Execute fund restructuring

Merge share classes or convert fund:

1. Obtain investor consent for restructuring
2. Calculate conversion ratios based on NAV
3. Navigate to **Actions** &gt; **Restructure**
4. Configure conversion parameters
5. Execute batch conversion
6. Mint new class units and burn old class units
7. Record restructuring in corporate actions

### Implement redemption gate

Limit redemptions during market stress:

1. Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Redemptions**
2. Click **Activate Gate**
3. Set gate parameters:
   - Maximum redemption percentage per period
   - Gate duration
4. Confirm activation
5. Platform pro-rates pending redemption requests
6. Notify investors of gate implementation

Requires EMERGENCY_ROLE permission.

### Process dividend distribution

Distribute fund income to investors:

**For funds with yield addon:**

1. Calculate distribution amount (income/capital gains)
2. Navigate to **Distributions** tab
3. Click **Schedule Distribution**
4. Configure:
   - Distribution token (USDC, USDT, etc.)
   - Amount per unit
   - Ex-dividend date
   - Payment date
5. Fund distribution wallet with total amount
6. Execute distribution on payment date

**Reinvestment option:**

Enable dividend reinvestment:

1. Toggle **Allow Reinvestment** on distribution
2. Investors opt into reinvestment via dApp
3. Platform mints new units instead of transferring tokens
4. Units minted at current NAV

## Best practices

**Before deployment:**

- Coordinate with legal counsel to ensure parameters match prospectus
- Test NAV calculation methodology and posting workflow
- Prepare investor onboarding pipeline
- Set up fund accounting system integration

**During lifecycle:**

- Post NAV updates consistently at scheduled time daily/weekly/monthly
- Monitor subscription queue daily to avoid investor delays
- Maintain redemption reserve to meet withdrawal requests
- Review compliance module settings quarterly for regulatory updates
- Keep management fee collection current to avoid large catch-up mints

**NAV operations:**

- Reconcile NAV with fund accounting system before posting
- Document NAV calculation methodology and inputs
- Maintain audit trail of all NAV updates
- Implement NAV deviation alerts for significant moves
- Test oracle failover procedures regularly

**Liquidity management:**

- Forecast redemption trends based on historical data
- Maintain stablecoin reserves for quick redemption settlement
- Monitor portfolio liquidity daily
- Have credit facilities in place for unexpected redemption waves

## Troubleshooting

**Deployment fails with "Invalid management fee"**

- Verify fee in basis points (not percentage)
- Check fee within allowed range (typically 0-500 basis points)
- Ensure fee rate matches configured maximum

**Subscription processing reverts**

- Verify investor OnchainID has all required claims
- Check payment token is configured for subscriptions
- Ensure NAV is posted for subscription settlement date
- Confirm investor not exceeding maximum holder count

**NAV update fails**

- Verify NAV deviation within allowed threshold
- Check your address has GOVERNANCE_ROLE
- Ensure NAV timestamp is after previous NAV
- Confirm NAV value is positive and reasonable

**Redemption processing reverts**

- Check notice period has elapsed
- Verify fund liquidity wallet has sufficient payout tokens
- Ensure redemption not exceeding gate limits
- Confirm investor holds sufficient units to redeem

**Fee collection fails**

- Verify fee collection enabled in settings
- Check accrued fee amount is non-zero
- Ensure sufficient time elapsed since last collection
- Confirm NAV is current for fee unit calculation
