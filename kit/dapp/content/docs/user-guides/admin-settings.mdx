configuration showing connected network details and real-time health metrics_

**Multi-network note:** Enterprise deployments may connect to private consortium
chains; configuration is deployment-specific.

## Step 3: Manage access control

Configure roles and permissions:

### System roles overview

Platform uses role-based access control (RBAC) with predefined roles:

**Platform-level roles:**

Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Permissions**:

- **PLATFORM_ADMIN** - Full system administrator
- **COMPLIANCE_OFFICER** - Manage compliance and KYC
- **ASSET_MANAGER** - Deploy and manage assets
- **CLAIM_ISSUER** - Issue identity claims
- **AUDITOR** - Read-only access to all data

**Token-level roles:**

Assigned per individual token:

- **GOVERNANCE_ROLE** - Token compliance and parameters
- **SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE** - Mint and burn tokens
- **CUSTODIAN_ROLE** - Freeze and recover tokens
- **EMERGENCY_ROLE** - Pause token transfers

![Roles overview](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Roles and
permissions page showing role hierarchy and permission matrix_

### Assign platform roles

Grant platform-level permissions:

1. Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Permissions**
2. Click **Assign Role**
3. Enter user address or select from directory
4. Select role to assign
5. Click **Grant Permission**
6. Platform grants role via access manager contract
7. User immediately gains associated permissions

**Role assignment:**

- PLATFORM_ADMIN: Assign to 2-3 trusted administrators using multisig wallets
- COMPLIANCE_OFFICER: Assign to compliance team members
- ASSET_MANAGER: Assign to treasury or operations team
- CLAIM_ISSUER: Assign to KYC provider or compliance system
- AUDITOR: Assign to external auditors or regulatory oversight

![Role assignment](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Role
assignment modal showing user selection, role dropdown, and grant button_

**Best practice:** Use multisig wallets for critical roles (PLATFORM_ADMIN,
CLAIM_ISSUER) to prevent single-point-of-failure.

### Revoke roles

Remove permissions:

1. Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Permissions** &gt; **Active Roles**
2. Find user in role members list
3. Click **Revoke** next to user address
4. Confirm revocation
5. User immediately loses permissions

**Offboarding:** Always revoke roles when staff leave organization or change
responsibilities.

## Step 4: Manage asset types

Configure which asset types are available:

### Asset type registry

View enabled asset types:

Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Asset Types**:

Platform shows enabled asset types:

- **Bonds** - Debt instruments
- **Equity** - Company shares
- **Funds** - Investment fund units
- **Stablecoins** - Fiat-pegged tokens
- **Deposits** - Certificate of deposit tokens

Each asset type shows:

- Factory contract address
- Number of deployed tokens
- Status (enabled/disabled)

![Asset types list](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot: Asset
types configuration showing enabled asset types with factory addresses and token
counts_

### Enable new asset type

Add asset type to platform:

If asset type was not deployed during onboarding:

1. Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Asset Types**
2. Click **Enable Asset Type**
3. Select asset type from available list
4. Review deployment parameters
5. Click **Deploy Factory**
6. Platform:
   - Deploys factory implementation contract
   - Deploys factory proxy
   - Registers factory in factory registry
   - Enables asset type in platform UI
7. Asset type now available for token creation

**Cost:** Factory deployment consumes gas; plan deployment during low-congestion
periods.

### Disable asset type

Temporarily disable asset type:

To prevent new token deployments without affecting existing tokens:

1. Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Asset Types**
2. Find asset type to disable
3. Click **Disable**
4. Confirm action
5. Asset type removed from token creation UI
6. Existing tokens continue functioning normally

**Use case:** Disable asset type during regulatory review or system upgrades.

## Step 5: Manage addon modules

Configure optional platform addons:

### Addon registry

View available addons:

Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Addons**:

Platform shows addon categories:

**Yield distribution:**

- Fixed yield schedule - Automated interest/dividend payments

**Airdrop mechanisms:**

- Push airdrop - Distribute tokens to recipients
- Time-bound airdrop - Claimable for limited time
- Vesting airdrop - Tokens unlock over vesting schedule

**Trading and settlement:**

- Token sale - Primary issuance sale mechanism
- Delivery versus payment (DvP) - Atomic asset exchange
- Vault - Token custody with access controls

Each addon shows deployment status and usage statistics.

5. Click **Confirm Deployment**
6. Platform:
   - Deploys addon factory contract
   - Registers in addon registry
   - Makes available in token creation and management UI
7. Addon now available for use with compatible tokens

**Selective deployment:** Only deploy addons needed for your use cases to
minimize deployment costs.

### Configure addon defaults

Set default addon parameters:

For commonly used addons:

1. Navigate to addon details page
2. Click **Configure Defaults**
3. Set default parameters:
   - Vesting cliff (e.g., 12 months)
   - Vesting duration (e.g., 48 months)
   - Distribution schedule (e.g., monthly)
4. Save defaults
5. New addon deployments pre-populate with defaults

**Efficiency:** Defaults streamline repetitive addon configurations.

## Step 6: Configure compliance settings

Set system-wide compliance parameters:

### Claim topics and issuers

Manage identity claim framework:

Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Compliance** &gt; **Claim Topics &
Issuers**:

   Backup**
2. Review backup schedule (daily recommended)
3. Verify backup location and retention
4. Test restoration procedure quarterly

**Configuration backup:**

Export platform configuration:

1. Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Maintenance** &gt; **Export
   Configuration**
2. Click **Generate Configuration Export**
3. Download JSON file containing:
   - Deployed contract addresses
   - Role assignments
   - Claim topics and issuers
   - Asset type registrations
   - Addon deployments
4. Store securely for disaster recovery

## Common workflows

### Upgrade platform contracts

Deploy new contract versions:

For proxy-based contracts (system, factories, tokens):

1. Prepare new implementation contract (development/testing complete)
2. Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Maintenance** &gt; **Upgrades**
3. Select contract to upgrade (e.g., "Bond Factory")
4. Enter new implementation address
5. Review upgrade impact analysis
6. Click **Propose Upgrade**
7. If multisig governance:
   - Other administrators review and approve
   - Execute upgrade after approval threshold met
8. Platform upgrades proxy to new implementation
9. Verify upgrade successful

**Testing:** Always test upgrades on staging environment before production
deployment.

### Migrate to new blockchain network

Move platform to different chain:

1. Deploy system contracts on new network
2. Migrate identity registry data:
   - Export investor OnchainIDs
   - Deploy OnchainIDs on new network
   - Re-issue claims
3. Migrate tokens:
   - Deploy new token contracts on new network
   - Coordinate with token holders for migration
   - Burn tokens on old network, mint on new network
4. Update platform network configuration
5. Communicate migration timeline to users

**Multi-chain:** Some deployments maintain presence on multiple chains
simultaneously for cross-chain asset transfers.

### Handle system emergency

Respond to security incidents:

If critical vulnerability or attack detected:

1. Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Emergency**
2. Click **Activate System Pause**
3. Pauses:
   - All token transfers
   - New token deployments
   - Claim issuance
   - Allows read-only operations
4. Investigate incident
5. Deploy fixes if needed
6. Navigate to **Emergency** &gt; **Deactivate Pause**
7. Resume normal operations

**Communication:** Notify users of emergency pause via status page and email.

## Best practices

**Access control:**

- Use multisig wallets for all platform admin roles
- Implement timelocks for critical operations
- Review role assignments quarterly
- Revoke unnecessary permissions (least privilege)
- Maintain role assignment documentation

**System monitoring:**

- Monitor transaction success rate daily
- Set up alerts for failed transaction thresholds
- Review gas costs weekly to optimize
- Track token deployment trends for capacity planning
- Monitor blockchain node health continuously

**Maintenance:**

- Schedule regular platform upgrades during low-traffic periods
- Test all upgrades in staging environment first
- Maintain rollback procedures for failed upgrades
- Document all configuration changes
- Perform quarterly disaster recovery drills

**Compliance:**

- Audit claim issuers annually
- Review compliance module configurations quarterly
- Update compliance templates for regulatory changes
- Maintain compliance audit trail
- Test compliance enforcement with sample transactions

## Troubleshooting

**Cannot access admin settings**

- Verify your address has PLATFORM_ADMIN role
- Check wallet connection and network
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Ensure using admin account (not investor account)

**Role assignment fails**

- Verify target address is valid Ethereum address
- Check you have permission to assign role (PLATFORM_ADMIN)
- Ensure role exists in access manager
- Confirm transaction has sufficient gas

**Asset type deployment fails**

- Check sufficient platform balance for factory deployment
- Verify factory implementation contracts exist
- Ensure factory registry is accessible
- Review deployment transaction revert reason

**Addon factory deployment reverts**

- Verify addon implementation contract deployed
- Check addon compatible with system version
- Ensure addon registry accessible
- Confirm sufficient gas for deployment

**System pause fails to activate**

- Verify you have EMERGENCY_ROLE on platform
- Check emergency module is not already paused
- Ensure sufficient gas for pause transaction
- Review access manager permissions
