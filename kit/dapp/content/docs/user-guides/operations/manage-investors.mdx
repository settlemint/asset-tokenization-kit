## Step 1: Investor registration

Initiate the onboarding process.

### Invite new investor

From the compliance dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Participants** &gt; **Entities** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Invite Investor** button
3. Choose invitation method:
   - **Email invitation** - Send invite link to investor email
   - **Direct registration** - Provide investor with registration URL

### Investor self-registration

Investor completes registration:

1. Investor receives invitation and clicks registration link
2. Platform presents onboarding flow:
   - Create account with email/password
   - Verify email address
   - Accept terms and conditions
   - Proceed to KYC verification
3. Investor lands on KYC verification portal

**Email verification:** Investor must verify email before proceeding to prevent
fraudulent registrations.

## Step 2: KYC/AML verification

Collect and verify investor identity.

### KYC data collection

Platform collects required information based on investor type:

**Individual investors:**

- Full legal name
- Date of birth
- Residential address
- Nationality and citizenship
- Government-issued ID (passport, driver's license, national ID)
- Tax identification number (SSN, EIN, VAT number)
- Source of funds declaration
- Employment and income information (for accredited investor determination)

**Institutional investors:**

- Legal entity name and type (corporation, LLC, trust, etc.)
- Registration/incorporation number
- Registered address
- Beneficial owners (25%+ ownership)
- Authorized signatories
- Corporate documents (articles of incorporation, certificates)
- Tax identification
- Financial statements (for qualified purchaser determination)

### Identity verification process

Platform verifies collected information:

**Automated verification:**

If integrated KYC provider configured:

1. Platform submits collected data to KYC service (Onfido, Jumio, Trulioo, etc.)
2. Service performs:
   - Document authenticity verification
   - Facial recognition match
   - Address verification
   - Database checks (PEP, sanctions, adverse media)
3. Results return to platform automatically
4. Investor receives verification status

**Manual verification:**

If manual review required:

1. Compliance officer reviews submitted documents
2. Navigate to **Participants** &gt; **Entities** &gt; **Pending KYC**
3. Select investor from queue
4. Review uploaded documents and information
5. Perform verification checks:
   - Document validity and authenticity
   - Address verification via utility bill or bank statement
   - Sanctions screening against OFAC, EU, UN lists
   - PEP screening
   - Adverse media search
6. Mark verification as **Approved** or **Rejected**

**Verification levels:**

- **Level 1 (Basic KYC)** - Name, address, date of birth verified
- **Level 2 (Enhanced KYC)** - Level 1 + document verification + sanctions
  screening
- **Level 3 (Enhanced Due Diligence)** - Level 2 + source of funds + enhanced
  monitoring

Set verification level requirement per asset type compliance rules.

## Step 3: OnchainID deployment

Create blockchain identity for verified investor.

### OnchainID creation

After KYC approval:

1. Navigate to investor details page: **Participants** &gt; **Entities** &gt;
   [Investor Name]
2. Review KYC status showing **Verified**
3. Click **Create OnchainID**
4. Platform:
   - Deploys OnchainID contract for investor (30-45 seconds)
   - Records OnchainID address in investor profile
   - Registers OnchainID in identity registry
5. OnchainID contract address appears on investor profile

**OnchainID:** Each investor has unique on-chain identity contract holding
verifiable claims about their status and compliance.

### Wallet linking

Associate investor wallets with OnchainID:

**Primary wallet (automatic):**

Platform automatically links wallet created during registration as primary key.

**Additional wallets:**

If investor needs multiple wallets:

1. Investor navigates to account settings in dApp
2. Clicks **Add Wallet**
3. Connects additional wallet via WalletConnect or direct signature
4. Platform adds wallet as management key on OnchainID
5. Multiple wallets now linked to same identity and claims

**Use case:** Investor may have hot wallet for trading and cold wallet for
long-term holding, both linked to same OnchainID.

## Step 4: Issue claims

Assign verifiable credentials to investor OnchainID.

### Required claims for asset access

Determine which claims investor needs based on target assets:

**Common claim types:**

- **KYC_VERIFIED** - Basic identity verification completed
- **ACCREDITED_INVESTOR** - Accredited investor status (Reg D)
- **QUALIFIED_PURCHASER** - Qualified purchaser status (3(c)(7) funds)
- **JURISDICTION** - Country of residence
- **INVESTOR_TYPE** - Individual, institutional, professional
- **SOPHISTICATED_INVESTOR** - EU sophisticated investor status
- **PEP_STATUS** - Politically exposed person classification

Review asset compliance requirements to determine necessary claims:

1. Navigate to **Asset Management** &gt; [Asset Type] &gt; [Specific Token]
2. Review **Compliance** tab showing required claims
3. Note which claims investor needs for eligibility

### Issue individual claims

Add claims to investor OnchainID:

1. Navigate to **Participants** &gt; **Entities** &gt; [Investor Name]
2. Scroll to **Claims** section
3. Click **Issue Claim**
4. Select claim type from dropdown (for example, ACCREDITED_INVESTOR)
5. Enter claim data:
   - **Claim topic** - Automatically filled based on type
   - **Claim data** - Encoded investor information (auto-generated)
   - **Expiration date** - When claim expires (optional, for example, 1 year for
     accredited status)
   - **URI** - Link to supporting documentation (optional)
6. Click **Sign and Issue Claim**
7. Platform:
   - Signs claim with platform claim issuer key
   - Adds claim to investor's OnchainID contract
   - Records claim in compliance database
8. Claim appears in investor's claims list

**Claim issuer:** Platform is registered as trusted claim issuer in the system.
Only trusted issuers can issue claims accepted by compliance modules.

### Batch claim issuance

Issue claims to multiple investors:

For common claims needed by many investors:

1. Navigate to **Participants** &gt; **Entities**
2. Select multiple investors via checkboxes
3. Click **Batch Actions** &gt; **Issue Claim**
4. Select claim type
5. Configure expiration (applies to all selected)
6. Click **Issue to All Selected**
7. Platform processes batch issuance
8. Review results showing successful/failed claim issuances

**Use case:** After quarterly accreditation verification, batch-issue renewed
ACCREDITED_INVESTOR claims to all qualifying investors.

## Step 5: Manage investor eligibility

Monitor and update investor compliance status.

### Check investor eligibility

You can verify which investors can hold which assets by reviewing:

1. Navigate to specific token: **Asset Management** &gt; [Asset Type] &gt;
   [Token]
2. Review **Compliance** tab for required claims
3. Compare against investor's active claims in **Participants** &gt;
   **Entities** &gt; [Investor]

**Note:** An automated eligibility matrix dashboard is planned for a future
release.

### Handle eligibility issues

Resolve investor compliance gaps:

**Missing claims:**

1. Identify investor missing required claim
2. Determine if investor qualifies for claim
3. If yes, issue claim per Step 4
4. If no, notify investor of additional requirements

**Expired claims:**

1. Monitor claims approaching expiration (check investor profiles regularly)
2. Contact investors 30 days before expiration
3. Request updated documentation for renewal
4. Review and re-issue claims with new expiration
5. If investor doesn't renew, claim expires and tokens become non-transferable

**Failed compliance checks:**

If investor fails ongoing monitoring (for example, added to sanctions list):

1. Navigate to investor profile
2. Click **Actions** &gt; **Revoke Claim**
3. Select claim to revoke (for example, KYC_VERIFIED)
4. Enter revocation reason
5. Confirm revocation
6. Platform removes claim from OnchainID
7. Investor immediately loses token transfer capability
8. Consider freezing investor's holdings: **Actions** &gt; **Freeze Account**

## Step 6: Ongoing compliance monitoring

Continuous surveillance of investor status.

### Automated screening

Configure automatic re-screening:

1. Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Compliance**
2. Set up periodic re-screening schedule with your KYC provider
3. Review alerts for any matches against sanctions lists

**Alert handling:**

When screening identifies match:

1. Review match details from your KYC provider
2. Investigate to determine true positive or false positive
3. Actions:
   - **False positive** - Document decision with notes
   - **True positive** - Revoke claims, freeze account, file SAR
   - **Uncertain** - Escalate for enhanced due diligence

### Transaction monitoring

Monitor investor transaction patterns using blockchain data:

1. Review investor transaction history on token details pages
2. Track for:
   - Unusual transaction sizes
   - High frequency trading patterns
   - Transactions exceeding configured velocity limits
3. Investigate suspicious activity
4. File Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) per BSA/AML requirements

**Monitoring rules:**

Configure transaction monitoring thresholds in compliance modules:

- **Amount threshold** - Flag transactions over $10,000 (CTR requirement)
- **Velocity limit** - Flag if investor exceeds volume within period
- **Pattern detection** - Identify structuring or smurfing patterns

## Step 7: Investor communications

Maintain investor relationship.

### Send notifications

Communicate with investors:

1. Navigate to **Participants** &gt; **Entities** &gt; [Investor Name]
2. Use your organization's standard communication channels
3. Common message types:
   - **Claim expiration reminder** - Send 30 days before expiration
   - **Compliance update** - Notify of new requirements
   - **Document request** - Request updated documents

### Investor data updates

Handle investor information changes:

**Address change:**

1. Investor submits address update request
2. Review supporting documentation (utility bill, etc.)
3. Approve or reject update in investor profile
4. If approved, update investor profile and re-issue JURISDICTION claim if
   country changed

**Accreditation renewal:**

1. Investor submits updated financial documentation annually
2. Compliance officer reviews income/net worth for accredited status
3. Re-issue ACCREDITED_INVESTOR claim with new expiration
4. Deny renewal if no longer qualifies; investor loses access to Reg D offerings

## Common workflows

### Onboard institutional investor

Additional steps for legal entities:

1. Collect corporate documentation:
   - Certificate of incorporation
   - Shareholder register
   - Board resolution authorizing investment
   - Beneficial ownership disclosure (UBO)
2. Verify each beneficial owner (25%+ ownership):
   - Perform individual KYC on each UBO
   - Issue individual OnchainIDs to UBOs
3. Create OnchainID for corporate entity
4. Link UBO OnchainIDs to corporate OnchainID
5. Issue entity-level claims (for example, QUALIFIED_PURCHASER)
6. Designate authorized signatories for corporate wallet

**Beneficial ownership:** Ensure all natural persons with 25%+ ownership are
verified per AML regulations.

### Handle investor offboarding

Remove investor from platform:

1. Ensure investor holds zero token balances across all assets
2. Navigate to investor profile
3. Click **Actions** &gt; **Offboard Investor**
4. Confirm investor has redeemed/transferred all holdings
5. Revoke all claims
6. Deactivate investor account
7. Archive investor records per data retention policy (typically 5-7 years)
8. Notify investor of account closure

**Data retention:** Maintain KYC records and transaction history per regulatory
requirements even after offboarding.

### Upgrade investor accreditation

Elevate investor status:

1. Investor submits documentation for higher qualification:
   - Income verification for accredited investor
   - Net worth documentation for qualified purchaser
   - Professional certification for sophisticated investor
2. Review documentation meets SEC/regulatory standards
3. Issue additional claim (for example, QUALIFIED_PURCHASER)
4. Investor gains access to additional asset offerings
5. Update investor tier in your records

**Investor tiers:** Common progression: Basic → Accredited → Qualified Purchaser

## Best practices

**KYC verification:**

- Use risk-based approach: higher verification for higher investment amounts
- Leverage automated KYC providers for efficiency and consistency
- Perform enhanced due diligence on high-risk investors (PEPs, high-risk
  jurisdictions)
- Refresh KYC annually or when material changes occur
- Maintain detailed audit trail of all verification decisions

**Claim management:**

- Set expiration dates on time-sensitive claims (accreditation, jurisdiction)
- Implement reminder system 30 days before claim expiration
- Batch-renew claims during annual refresh cycles
- Monitor claim usage: revoke unused claims to maintain hygiene
- Use claim versioning to track renewals and updates

**Ongoing monitoring:**

- Screen against sanctions lists regularly (OFAC updates frequently)
- Review PEP lists quarterly
- Conduct adverse media searches semi-annually
- Monitor transaction patterns continuously
- Escalate alerts to compliance leadership within 24 hours

**Regulatory compliance:**

- File CTRs (Currency Transaction Reports) for $10,000+ transactions within 15
  days
- File SARs (Suspicious Activity Reports) within 30 days of detection
- Maintain independent compliance audit trail
- Update procedures for regulatory changes
- Train compliance staff quarterly

## Troubleshooting

**OnchainID deployment fails**

- Check platform has sufficient gas for deployment
- Verify investor wallet address is valid
- Ensure investor doesn't already have OnchainID
- Retry deployment after 30 seconds if network congestion

**Claim issuance reverts**

- Verify investor has OnchainID deployed
- Check claim issuer has CLAIM_ISSUER_ROLE
- Ensure claim topic exists in topic registry
- Confirm claim data format is correct (bytes format)

**Investor cannot transfer tokens despite claims**

- Verify all required claims are present (not just some)
- Check claim expiration dates (expired claims invalid)
- Ensure claim issuer is trusted issuer for token
- Review token compliance module for additional restrictions

**KYC verification stuck in pending**

- Check KYC provider API connection status
- Review submitted documents for quality (blurry images fail)
- Verify investor completed all required fields
- Manually approve if automated verification unavailable
