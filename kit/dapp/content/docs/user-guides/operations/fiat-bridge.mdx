**Primary audience:** Treasury operations staff, payment processors  
**Secondary audience:** Banking integration teams, compliance officers

## The fiat-crypto bridge challenge

Bridging traditional finance with blockchain introduces a fundamental settlement
timing mismatch. Bank wires take 1-3 business days (T+1 to T+3) while blockchain
transfers settle in seconds. This creates liquidity risk, operational
complexity, and reconciliation headaches.

ATK's fiat bridge solves this by combining DALP vault custody with real-time
observability. Treasury operators can monitor deposits in flight, track
redemption liabilities, and maintain reserve ratios—all from integrated
dashboards that show both on-chain and off-chain positions simultaneously.

The challenge isn't just moving money between systems. It's maintaining accurate
accounting when one side operates 24/7 (blockchain) while the other works
banker's hours (wire transfers). Without proper tooling, teams resort to
spreadsheets and manual reconciliation that break down at scale.

## Before you start

**Prerequisites:**

- Platform stablecoin deployed (see
  [Issue a stablecoin](/docs/user-guides/asset-issuance/issue-stablecoin))
- Banking relationship with wire transfer capabilities
- KYC procedures integrated with OnchainID registry
- Access to observability dashboards

**Time estimate:** Initial setup 2-3 hours; ongoing operations are
transaction-by-transaction

**Required knowledge:**

- Treasury operations and wire transfer processing
- AML/KYC compliance procedures
- Basic blockchain wallet operations

## Choose your on-ramp provider

Your first decision: integrate directly with banks via wire transfers, use a
specialized on-ramp provider, or support both paths. Each approach has distinct
tradeoffs for speed, cost, and regulatory complexity.

### Direct bank integration

**When to use:** You have existing banking relationships and treasury operations
team familiar with wire processing. Common for issuers handling institutional
investors or regulated financial products.

**Advantages:**

- No third-party fees (save 25-50 bps per transaction)
- Full control over settlement timing
- Simplest regulatory structure (no additional money transmitter licenses)
- Works for any transaction size

**Disadvantages:**

- Manual reconciliation required (unless banking API integrated)
- Slower settlement (T+1 to T+3 for wires)
- Business hours only (no weekend or holiday processing)
- Higher operational overhead for treasury team

**Check the bridge status panel** in observability dashboards to monitor pending
wire verification queue and average processing times.

### Third-party on-ramp providers (Wyre, Circle, Stripe)

**When to use:** You need instant deposits, want to support retail investors
with smaller transaction sizes, or lack in-house treasury operations.

**Advantages:**

- Instant settlement (seconds instead of days)
- Automated reconciliation via API
- Support for credit cards and ACH
- 24/7 operation including weekends
- Provider handles AML screening

**Disadvantages:**

- Transaction fees (typically 50-100 bps)
- Provider KYC may duplicate your OnchainID verification
- Transaction size limits (often max $10,000-$50,000)
- Additional counterparty risk
- Regulatory dependency (provider must maintain licenses)

**Integration approach:**

1. Register with provider (Wyre, Circle, Stripe Crypto)
2. Configure webhook endpoints to receive deposit notifications
3. Link provider's user ID with investor's OnchainID address
4. Mint tokens automatically when webhook confirms deposit
5. Monitor provider status via observability dashboard integration

**Check the payment provider dashboard** to track provider API health, webhook
delivery rates, and fee accumulation.

### Hybrid approach (recommended for institutional issuers)

Support both paths:

- Wires for institutional investors and large transactions (&gt;$50,000)
- On-ramp providers for retail investors and smaller amounts (&lt;$50,000)

This balances cost efficiency (wires for large amounts) with user experience
(instant deposits for retail).

## Configure bridge settings

### Banking configuration

Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Banking**.

Configuring bank accounts establishes the receiving endpoint for investor wires.
Treasury teams need complete account details to generate wire instructions that
investors will use. Multi-currency support requires separate accounts per
currency to avoid forex conversion ambiguity.

**Bank account details:**

- **Bank name** - Financial institution name
- **Account holder** - Legal entity name (must match issuer entity on
  securities)
- **Account number** - Bank account number for wire deposits
- **SWIFT/BIC code** - International bank identifier
- **Routing number** - Domestic routing (US) or sort code (UK)
- **IBAN** - International bank account number (Europe)

**Multi-currency configuration:**

To support multiple fiat currencies, add an account for each:

1. Click **Add Currency Account**
2. Select currency (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
3. Enter bank details specific to that currency
4. Set currency-specific transaction limits
5. Configure exchange rate source (manual or API)

![Banking configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Banking
configuration showing bank account details for multiple currencies with account
numbers and SWIFT codes_

**CRITICAL: Use segregated accounts.** Never commingle fiat bridge deposits with
operational funds. Segregated accounts simplify reconciliation and demonstrate
reserve backing to auditors.

**Check the bank balance panel** in observability dashboards to compare actual
bank balance against expected balance calculated from token supply.

### Stablecoin configuration

Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Stablecoins**.

Linking stablecoins to the bridge establishes which tokens represent fiat
deposits. You can bridge your platform stablecoin (full control, no third-party
risk) or external stablecoins like USDC (widely accepted, network effects).

**Supported stablecoins:**

- **Platform stablecoin** - If issued via
  [Issue a stablecoin](/docs/user-guides/asset-issuance/issue-stablecoin)
- **External stablecoins** - USDC, USDT, or other third-party stablecoins

**Configure each stablecoin:**

1. Click **Add Stablecoin**
2. Enter token contract address
3. Verify token details auto-populate (name, symbol, decimals)
4. Set conversion parameters:
   - **Peg ratio** - Typically 1:1 (1 token = 1 fiat unit)
   - **Deposit fee** - Basis points charged on fiat-to-token (e.g., 0-50 bps)
   - **Redemption fee** - Basis points charged on token-to-fiat (e.g., 0-50 bps)
   - **Minimum deposit** - Minimum fiat amount (e.g., $100)
   - **Minimum redemption** - Minimum token amount (e.g., $100 equivalent)
5. Click **Enable Stablecoin**

**Fee structure considerations:**

Common setup is 0% deposit fee (to encourage onboarding) and 10-25 bps
redemption fee to cover wire costs and maintain spread. The redemption fee
should cover your banking wire fees plus a small margin.

For example, if your bank charges $25 per outbound wire, a 25 bps fee on a
$10,000 redemption generates $25 to cover the cost. For smaller redemptions,
consider a minimum fee (e.g., $25 minimum or 25 bps, whichever is greater).

![Stablecoin configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Stablecoin
configuration showing enabled stablecoins with contract addresses, peg ratios,
fees, and minimum amounts_

**Check the stablecoin metrics panel** to monitor total supply by stablecoin,
mint/burn rates, and fee accumulation over time.

### Operational parameters

Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Operations**.

These parameters define your SLAs to investors. Be realistic—promising T+0
settlement when your treasury team operates 9-5 creates expectation mismatches.
Align cut-off times with your banking hours and internal processing capacity.

**Settlement timing:**

- **Deposit settlement** - T+0, T+1, T+2 for token minting after fiat receipt
  verification
- **Redemption settlement** - T+1, T+2, T+3 for fiat payout after token burn
- **Cut-off time** - Daily deadline for same-day processing (e.g., 3:00 PM local
  time)

Example configuration for institutional issuer:

- Deposits: T+1 settlement with 3:00 PM cut-off (wires received by 3 PM verified
  and minted next business day)
- Redemptions: T+2 settlement (redemption requests approved today, wires sent
  two business days later)

This gives treasury time to verify deposits and arrange funding for redemption
wires.

**Transaction limits:**

- **Daily deposit limit** - Maximum total deposits per day
- **Daily redemption limit** - Maximum total redemptions per day (liquidity
  constraint)
- **Per-transaction maximum** - Largest single deposit/redemption
- **Velocity limits** - Maximum per address per time period (AML control)

Set limits based on liquidity capacity. For redemptions, your daily limit should
not exceed your available bank balance plus same-day liquidity sources (credit
lines, on-demand liquidity pools).

**Operational hours:**

- **Business days** - Monday-Friday (exclude holidays)
- **Business hours** - 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM (for manual processing)
- **Holiday calendar** - US Federal, UK, EU holidays

When operations are closed, deposits queue for next business day processing.
Communicate this clearly to investors to avoid support inquiries.

![Operational parameters](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Operational
parameters showing settlement times, transaction limits, business hours, and
holiday calendar_

**Check the bridge operations dashboard** to monitor current queue depths,
average processing times, and SLA compliance rates.

## Process fiat deposits

The fiat-to-token flow converts investor wire transfers into on-chain token
balances. Each deposit moves through verification (confirm receipt and investor
identity) then minting (issue tokens to investor address).

/>

### Receive wire transfer

Investors initiate wire transfers to your configured bank account. Each wire
must include reference information linking it to the investor's platform account
or OnchainID address.

**Generate deposit instructions:**

Navigate to **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Deposit Instructions**:

1. Click **Generate Deposit Instructions**
2. Platform creates unique deposit reference code for investor
3. System generates complete wire instructions including:
   - Bank account details
   - Unique deposit reference code
   - Required memo/reference field format
4. Share instructions with investor via email or investor portal

The reference code is critical. Without it, treasury must manually match wires
to investors using name and amount—error-prone and slow.

**Investor wire format:**

Investors receive instructions like:

```
Bank: JP Morgan Chase
Account: Asset Tokenization Platform LLC
Account Number: 123456789
Routing: 021000021
SWIFT: CHASUS33

Reference/Memo: DEPOSIT-A7B3C9D2

IMPORTANT: Include reference code in wire memo field.
```

The reference code links automatically to the investor's OnchainID during
verification.

### Verify deposit receipt

Treasury confirms fiat arrived in bank account and links it to the correct
investor.

**Automated verification (if banking API integrated):**

1. Platform polls bank account for incoming wires every 15 minutes
2. New deposits appear in **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Pending Deposits**
3. Platform matches deposit to investor via reference code
4. Amount, sender, and investor verified automatically
5. Move to mint queue

**Check the deposit verification panel** to see incoming wires awaiting
verification and average time from wire receipt to verification.

**Manual verification (no banking API):**

1. Check business bank account for incoming wires (via bank portal)
2. Navigate to **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Pending Deposits**
3. Click **Record Deposit**
4. Enter deposit details:
   - Deposit amount (fiat)
   - Deposit currency
   - Wire reference number (from bank statement)
   - Wire date
   - Investor address (lookup by reference code or email)
5. Click **Verify Deposit**

Platform now:

- Links deposit to investor account
- Calculates token mint amount (deposit - fees) / peg ratio
- Marks deposit as verified and ready for minting

![Deposit verification](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Deposit
verification showing pending wire transfers with amount, currency, reference,
investor lookup, and verify button_

**Daily reconciliation:** Before processing each day's deposits, reconcile bank
account balance against platform recorded deposits. Discrepancies indicate
missed wires or data entry errors.

**Check the reconciliation dashboard** to compare expected bank balance (from
platform records) against actual balance (from banking API or manual entry).

### Mint tokens

After verification, issue tokens to investor addresses. This is where fiat
becomes blockchain-native value.

Navigate to **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Verified Deposits**.

**Review deposit ready for minting:**

Each verified deposit shows:

- Investor OnchainID address
- Fiat amount deposited
- Applicable fees (deposit fee + wire fees)
- Net token mint amount: (fiat amount - fees) / peg ratio
- Stablecoin to mint
- Settlement date (based on verification time and T+0/T+1 policy)

**CRITICAL: Verify investor compliance status.** Platform automatically checks
OnchainID verification status and compliance module eligibility before allowing
mint. If investor lacks required claims or is on blocklist, mint will fail with
clear error.

**Mint single deposit:**

1. Click **Mint Tokens**
2. Platform executes mint transaction on-chain
3. Records mint transaction hash on deposit record
4. Updates investor token balance
5. Sends notification to investor (email + in-app)
6. Marks deposit as complete

**Batch minting (for multiple deposits):**

Treasury teams processing 10-100 daily deposits benefit from batch operations:

1. Select deposits via checkboxes (all ready for minting)
2. Click **Batch Mint**
3. Platform processes all in sequence
4. Review batch results—shows successful mints and any failures with reasons

**Check the mint operations panel** to monitor mint transaction success rates,
average gas costs, and mint volume by stablecoin.

![Token minting](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Verified deposits showing
deposit details, calculated token amounts, and mint buttons with batch
processing option_

**Compliance integration:** The minting step synchronizes with OnchainID claims.
Platform validates:

- Investor has KYC claim with issuer signature
- Investor is not on blocklist
- Investor meets minimum investment requirements (if configured)
- Token transfer restrictions allow mint to this address

If any check fails, mint is blocked and deposit queued for manual review or
refund.

**DALP vault integration:** Minted tokens represent claims on vault-held
reserves. Ensure vault custody arrangements match token supply to maintain 1:1
backing. Check vault reserve ratio in observability dashboards after large mint
operations.

## Process redemption requests

The token-to-fiat flow converts on-chain balances back to bank wire transfers.
Investors request redemption, treasury approves and burns tokens, then executes
wire transfers.

/>

### Receive redemption request

Investors initiate redemption via the dApp interface.

**Investor workflow:**

1. Navigate to **Account** &gt; **Redeem Tokens** in dApp
2. Enter redemption details:
   - Token amount to redeem
   - Fiat currency to receive (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
   - Banking details:
     - Beneficiary name (must match KYC records)
     - Bank account number or IBAN
     - SWIFT/BIC code
     - Bank name and address
3. Review redemption fees and net fiat amount
4. Click **Submit Redemption Request**
5. Platform creates redemption request and queues for treasury approval

**Treasury notification:**

New redemption appears in **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Redemption Requests** with
timestamp and estimated settlement date based on operational parameters.

**Check the redemption queue panel** to monitor pending redemptions by volume
and value, average queue time, and approaching SLA deadlines.

### Review redemption request

Treasury verifies investor identity, compliance status, and banking details
before approving redemption.

Navigate to **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Redemption Requests**.

**Review request details:**

- **Investor identity:** OnchainID address, KYC claim status, investor name from
  claims
- **Token amount:** Amount to burn (check investor holds sufficient balance)
- **Banking details:** Beneficiary name, account number, SWIFT/BIC
- **Fees:** Redemption fee (basis points or minimum)
- **Net fiat payout:** Token amount × peg ratio - fees
- **Settlement date:** Based on request time and cut-off policy (T+1, T+2, etc.)

**CRITICAL verification: Banking details must match KYC records.** This prevents
redemption to third-party accounts (potential money laundering vector). If
beneficiary name does not match investor name from KYC claims, flag for manual
review.

**Compliance checks:**

- KYC claim status current (not expired)
- Investor not on blocklist or sanctions lists
- Banking details match verified KYC records
- Investor holds sufficient token balance (>= requested amount)
- Redemption amount meets minimum threshold

**Check the compliance metrics panel** to see redemption rejection rates by
reason and identify patterns requiring investor education.

![Redemption review](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Redemption request
details showing investor info, token amount, banking details, fees, net payout,
and approve/reject buttons_

### Approve or reject redemption

**Approve redemption:**

1. Click **Approve Redemption**
2. Confirm approval
3. Platform executes burn transaction on-chain
4. Tokens removed from investor address
5. Redemption moves to **Pending Payout** queue with settlement date
6. Liability recorded for fiat payout

**DALP vault impact:** Burned tokens reduce liability against vault reserves.
Monitor vault reserve ratio to ensure sufficient liquidity for pending payouts.

**Reject redemption:**

If compliance or verification issues found:

1. Click **Reject Redemption**
2. Select rejection reason:
   - Banking details mismatch
   - KYC claim expired or missing
   - Insufficient token balance
   - Suspicious activity flag
   - Sanctions list match
3. Enter detailed notes for audit trail
4. Confirm rejection

Platform now:

- Cancels redemption request
- Notifies investor with rejection reason
- Tokens remain in investor wallet
- Logs rejection in audit trail

**Rejection metrics:** Monitor rejection rate in observability dashboards. High
rejection rates (>5%) indicate investor education needed on banking details
verification or KYC claim renewal.

**Check the redemption approval panel** to track approval throughput, average
review time per request, and pending approvals approaching SLA deadlines.

### Execute fiat payout

Transfer fiat from issuer bank account to investor bank account.

Navigate to **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Pending Payouts**.

This queue shows approved redemptions with settlement date reached. Treasury
must execute wire transfers to complete redemptions.

**Liquidity planning:** Before processing payouts, verify bank account balance
covers total payout amount plus wire fees. If insufficient, arrange funding
(transfer from reserves, draw on credit line, liquidate collateral).

**Check the vault liquidity panel** to see available reserves, pending payout
liabilities, and reserve ratio. Alert if ratio drops below configured threshold
(typically 100-110%).

**Automated payout (if payment processor integrated):**

1. Select redemptions for payout (filter by settlement date = today)
2. Click **Execute Automated Payout**
3. Platform sends payout instructions to payment processor API
4. Processor initiates wire transfers
5. Webhook confirms wire execution
6. Platform marks redemptions as paid
7. Updates observability metrics

**Manual payout (via business banking portal):**

1. Click **Export Payout Batch** to generate CSV with wire details
2. Review CSV contents (beneficiary, account, amount per redemption)
3. Process wire transfers via business banking portal (one by one or bulk upload
   if bank supports)
4. After each wire executes:
   - Navigate to redemption record in platform
   - Click **Mark as Paid**
   - Enter wire confirmation number (from bank)
   - Enter payout date (when wire executed)
   - Confirm completion
5. Platform records payout and notifies investor

**Batch wire processing:** Many banks support bulk wire file upload (ISO 20022
format). Export batch as XML, upload to bank portal, approve batch. This reduces
manual entry from 100 clicks to 1 upload + 1 approval.

![Payout processing](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Pending payouts
showing redemptions grouped by currency with amounts, investor details, and
execute payout buttons_

**Settlement timing discipline:** Honor stated settlement periods (T+1, T+2)
rigorously. Delayed redemptions damage investor confidence and may violate
contractual obligations. If delays occur, proactively notify investors with
updated timeline.

**Check the payout execution panel** to monitor wire execution rates, average
payout processing time, and SLA compliance percentage.

## Monitor bridge operations with observability

The bridge dashboard aggregates metrics across deposit verification, minting,
redemption approval, and payout execution. This unified view prevents
operational blind spots.

Navigate to **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Dashboard**.

### Volume statistics

Track fiat-crypto flow patterns over time:

- **Total deposits** (24h, 7d, 30d) - Fiat inflows
- **Total redemptions** (24h, 7d, 30d) - Fiat outflows
- **Net flow** - Deposits minus redemptions (positive = growing AUM, negative =
  redemptions exceeding deposits)
- **Average transaction size** - Helps segment retail vs institutional activity

**Trend analysis:** Sustained negative net flow indicates redemption pressure.
Check vault liquidity and consider marketing campaigns to attract new deposits.

**Check the bridge volume chart** to visualize deposit/redemption trends over 30
days with overlaid liquidity reserve levels.

### Processing metrics

Monitor operational efficiency:

- **Pending deposits count** - Awaiting verification
- **Pending redemptions count** - Awaiting approval
- **Average processing time** - Time from request to completion
- **Failed transaction rate** - Mints or burns that failed on-chain

**Operational targets:**

- Deposit verification time: &lt;4 hours (for T+0 settlement) or &lt;24 hours
  (for T+1)
- Redemption approval time: &lt;24 hours
- Failed transaction rate: &lt;0.1% (investigate any failures immediately)

**Check the bridge processing metrics panel** to see queue depths and processing
time percentiles (p50, p95, p99).

### Financial metrics

Track fees, liabilities, and reserve backing:

- **Total fees collected** - Accumulated from deposit and redemption fees
- **Outstanding redemption liability** - Sum of approved redemptions pending
  payout
- **Bank account balance vs. token supply** - Reserve ratio validation
- **Vault reserve ratio** - Total vault holdings / token supply (target: 100%+)

**CRITICAL: Reserve ratio monitoring.** Token supply must never exceed vault
reserves (including bank balance + custodied assets). If ratio drops below 100%,
you have undercollateralization risk.

**Alert thresholds:**

- Reserve ratio &lt;105%: Warning (schedule reserve top-up)
- Reserve ratio &lt;100%: Critical (halt redemptions until funded)
- Outstanding redemption liability &gt;50% of bank balance: Warning (arrange
  liquidity)

**Check the vault reserve panel** in observability dashboards to see real-time
reserve ratio with historical chart and alert status.

![Bridge dashboard](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Fiat bridge dashboard
showing volume charts, processing queues, financial metrics, and trend graphs_

### Reconciliation workflow

Ensure fiat and token balances align daily.

Navigate to **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Reconciliation**.

**Daily reconciliation process:**

1. Review reconciliation report showing:
   - **Bank account balance** (fiat) - Current balance from banking API or
     manual entry
   - **Total token supply** - On-chain token supply minted via bridge
   - **Pending deposits** - Not yet minted (in verification queue)
   - **Pending redemptions** - Approved but not yet paid (payout queue)
   - **Expected bank balance** - (Token supply + pending deposits - pending
     redemptions)
2. Compare expected vs. actual bank balance
3. If variance &gt;$100 or 0.1%, investigate
4. Mark reconciliation complete after resolving discrepancies

**DALP advantage: Unified registry.** Traditional bridge systems require 3-way
reconciliation (bank, blockchain, internal database). DALP's on-chain registry
eliminates the internal database as source of truth—blockchain state is
authoritative. This reduces reconciliation points from 3 to 2.

**Discrepancy resolution:**

If balances don't match, investigate:

- **Unmatched wire transfers:** Check bank for wires received but not recorded
  in platform
- **Missed deposits:** Verify all wires have corresponding deposit records
- **Unauthorized mints:** Review mint transaction history for unexpected entries
- **Unpaid redemptions:** Check for redemptions marked paid but wires never
  executed
- **Bank fees:** Wire fees may reduce balance without corresponding platform
  transaction

**Check the reconciliation variance panel** to see historical variance trends
and identify chronic reconciliation issues requiring process improvement.

![Reconciliation report](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Reconciliation
report showing bank balances, token supply, pending transactions, and variance
analysis_

**Frequency:** Perform reconciliation daily before processing new deposits or
redemptions. Monthly comprehensive reconciliation with accounting team review.

## Troubleshooting with observability

When issues occur, dashboards provide diagnostic starting point.

### Deposit not appearing in pending queue

**Symptom:** Investor reports wire sent, but deposit not showing in platform.

**Investigation:**

1. **Check the deposit receipt panel** in bridge dashboard for recent incoming
   wires
2. Navigate to **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Deposit History** and search by investor
   name or amount
3. Verify wire completed in bank account (check bank portal)
4. Check reference code format in wire memo matches expected format

**Common causes:**

- **Wire in transit:** Banking system shows pending, not yet settled (wait 24
  hours)
- **Wrong reference code:** Investor omitted or mistyped reference code in wire
  memo
- **Amount below minimum:** Deposit amount less than configured minimum
  threshold
- **Banking API delay:** If automated matching, API sync may lag (refresh
  manually)

**Resolution:**

- If reference code missing: Manually record deposit via **Record Deposit** and
  link to investor by name
- If below minimum: Contact investor to request top-up or refund original wire
- If API delay: Force sync via **Refresh Bank Transactions** button

**Check the deposit matching panel** to see failed automatic matches awaiting
manual linkage.

### Cannot mint tokens for verified deposit

**Symptom:** Verified deposit in queue, but mint operation fails.

**Investigation:**

1. Click **View Mint Error** on failed deposit
2. Review error message (e.g., "Investor not eligible", "Insufficient mint
   capacity")
3. Navigate to **Identity** &gt; **Investors** and search investor OnchainID
4. Check investor compliance status:
   - KYC claim present and verified?
   - Investor on any blocklists?
   - Investor meets token transfer restrictions?

**Common causes:**

- **Missing OnchainID:** Investor lacks verified OnchainID claim from issuer
- **Expired KYC:** Investor's KYC claim expired since deposit initiated
- **Blocklist:** Investor added to blocklist due to compliance issue
- **Mint capacity:** Token contract has supply cap, and cap reached
- **Role missing:** Platform lacks `SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE` on token contract

**Resolution:**

- If missing OnchainID: Request investor complete KYC verification before
  minting
- If expired KYC: Request investor renew KYC, then retry mint
- If blocklisted: Manual review required (potential refund or compliance
  resolution)
- If supply cap: Increase token supply cap via governance or use different token
- If role missing: Grant `SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE` to platform address

**Check the compliance metrics panel** to see mint rejection reasons and
identify systemic compliance issues.

### Redemption request rejected by platform

**Symptom:** Investor's redemption request automatically rejected.

**Investigation:**

1. Navigate to **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Rejected Redemptions**
2. View rejection reason for specific request
3. Common reasons:
   - Insufficient token balance
   - Banking details incomplete
   - Amount below minimum threshold
   - Token transfers paused (contract-level emergency pause)

**Resolution:**

- **Insufficient balance:** Investor spent tokens between request and approval
  (inform investor of current balance)
- **Incomplete banking:** Request investor provide complete wire details
  (account number, SWIFT)
- **Below minimum:** Investor must request larger redemption or accept queue
  until minimum met
- **Transfers paused:** Wait for issuer to unpause token transfers (typically
  after emergency investigation)

**Check the redemption rejection panel** to monitor rejection rate by reason and
identify need for investor education campaigns.

### Wire transfer failed or returned

**Symptom:** Payout marked as sent, but investor reports no receipt. Bank
returns wire with error.

**Investigation:**

1. Check wire confirmation details in platform
2. Contact bank for wire status (reference confirmation number)
3. Review bank's error message (typically: invalid account, beneficiary name
   mismatch, SWIFT error)

**Common causes:**

- **Invalid account number:** Investor provided incorrect account number or IBAN
- **Name mismatch:** Beneficiary name on wire does not match account holder name
  at receiving bank
- **Bank does not accept international wires:** Some banks block SWIFT wires
- **Insufficient correspondent banking:** SWIFT routing path fails at
  intermediate bank

**Resolution:**

1. If wire returned, funds back in issuer account (redemption still burned)
2. Contact investor for corrected banking details
3. Verify corrected details match KYC records
4. Re-execute wire with updated information
5. Update redemption record with new wire confirmation

**Wire return handling:** Returned wires create accounting complexity.
Redemption already burned tokens, so liability remains. Track returned wires
separately in **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Wire Returns** queue until re-executed.

**Check the wire execution panel** to monitor wire success rates by currency and
identify problematic correspondent banking routes.

### Reconciliation shows discrepancy

**Symptom:** Daily reconciliation shows bank balance does not match expected
balance.

**Investigation:**

1. Review **Reconciliation** &gt; **Variance Detail**
2. Check for unmatched transactions:
   - **Unrecorded deposits:** Wires in bank but not in platform (search bank
     statement for unexpected wires)
   - **Unpaid redemptions:** Platform shows paid, but wire never executed (check
     wire confirmation numbers)
   - **Bank fees:** Wire fees deducted from account (add as reconciliation
     adjustment)
   - **Manual mints:** Tokens minted outside bridge system (governance action,
     emergency mint)
3. Calculate net variance after adjustments
4. If still discrepant, escalate to accounting team

**Resolution process:**

- **Add unrecorded deposits:** Manually record via **Record Deposit**
- **Fix unpaid redemptions:** Re-execute wires for redemptions incorrectly
  marked paid
- **Document bank fees:** Add bank fee entries to reconciliation log
- **Review manual mints:** Verify manual mints were authorized and properly
  recorded

**CRITICAL: Never ignore discrepancies.** Reconciliation variance indicates
either operational error or potential fraud. Investigate every variance before
marking reconciliation complete.

**Check the reconciliation audit log** to see historical variances, resolution
actions, and identify recurring issues requiring process changes.

### High latency in compliance checks

**Symptom:** Mint operations slow (&gt;30s per transaction).

**Investigation:**

1. Navigate to **Observability** &gt; **Compliance Metrics**
2. Check **Compliance Check Duration** panel
3. Identify average check time and p99 latency
4. Review **Compliance Module Count** - How many modules are executing?

**Common causes:**

- **Too many compliance modules:** 10+ modules executing per transfer
- **Complex module expressions:** Modules using expensive on-chain lookups
- **RPC gateway congestion:** Besu node or ERPC gateway overloaded

**Resolution:**

- **Reduce module count:** Consolidate redundant compliance rules
- **Optimize module logic:** Simplify complex expressions, cache repeated
  lookups
- **Scale RPC capacity:** Add ERPC replicas or Besu validator nodes

**Check the compliance check latency panel** in observability dashboards to see
p50/p95/p99 latencies and identify slow compliance modules.

## Best practices

### Deposit processing discipline

- Process verified deposits within stated settlement period (T+0 by end of day,
  T+1 by next business day)
- Reconcile bank account before processing each day's deposits (catch missed
  wires)
- Maintain audit trail of all deposit verifications (compliance requirement)
- Use unique reference codes for every deposit (eliminates manual matching)
- Automate deposit matching via banking API where possible (reduces treasury
  workload)

### Redemption processing discipline

- Verify banking details against KYC records 100% of time (prevents misdirected
  wires)
- Process redemptions strictly first-in-first-out (fairness and regulatory
  compliance)
- Maintain sufficient bank balance for redemption liability (monitor vault
  reserve ratio)
- Monitor redemption queue depth (alert if approaching daily limit)
- Honor stated settlement periods rigorously (T+1, T+2, etc.)

**DALP DvP advantage:** For asset redemptions (bonds, deposits maturing), use
DvP settlement to atomically exchange asset tokens for stablecoin. This
eliminates redemption timing risk—investor receives fiat-backed stablecoin
instantly, then redeems stablecoin to fiat on their timeline.

### Reconciliation discipline

- Perform daily reconciliation before processing new transactions (never skip)
- Investigate discrepancies immediately (don't accumulate variance)
- Maintain 3-way reconciliation: bank account, on-chain token supply, platform
  database
- Document all discrepancy resolutions in audit trail
- Monthly comprehensive reconciliation review with accounting team

**Observability-first approach:** Check reconciliation variance panel every
morning. Sustained variance indicates systemic process issue requiring
investigation.

### Liquidity management

- Monitor vault reserve ratio in observability dashboards (target: 105%+)
- Set alerts for reserve ratio &lt;105% (warning) and &lt;100% (critical)
- Plan liquidity for redemption waves (large investor exits, market stress)
- Maintain credit line or on-demand liquidity source for emergencies
- Consider staggered redemption processing if liquidity constrained (process
  largest redemptions first to maintain reserve ratio)

**Check the vault liquidity panel** daily to see available reserves, pending
redemption liabilities, and reserve ratio trend.

### Security discipline

- Implement dual approval for large redemptions (&gt;$50,000)
- Use separate bank accounts for bridge operations (never commingle with
  operational funds)
- Monitor unusual deposit/redemption patterns (observability alerts for velocity
  anomalies)
- Screen all transactions against sanctions lists (automated via compliance
  modules)
- Maintain secure storage of wire confirmation numbers (audit trail requirement)
- Restrict banking detail changes (require re-verification if investor updates
  bank account)

## Results

After completing these steps, you will have:

- Configured fiat bridge with banking details and stablecoin settings
- Chosen on-ramp provider strategy (direct wires, third-party, or hybrid)
- Established operational parameters for deposits and redemptions with clear
  SLAs
- Processed fiat deposits from verification through token minting
- Handled redemption requests from approval through wire execution
- Implemented observability-driven monitoring and reconciliation procedures

Your fiat bridge now operates as treasury infrastructure connecting traditional
finance with DALP vaults. Daily operations center on observability dashboards
that show deposit queues, redemption liabilities, vault reserves, and
reconciliation status in real time.

The observability integration means treasury teams diagnose issues from
dashboards before investors report problems. Check the bridge status panel each
morning to verify queue depths, processing times, and reserve ratios are within
targets.
