## Overview

Configure and operate the fiat-token bridge to enable conversion between
traditional fiat currency and on-chain tokens. Handle investor deposits, token
minting, redemption requests, and fiat payouts through integrated banking rails.

**Primary audience:** Treasury operations staff, payment processors  
**Secondary audience:** Banking integration teams, customer service
representatives

The fiat bridge supports two primary flows:

**Fiat-to-token (Deposits):**

1. Investor wires fiat to issuer bank account
2. Treasury verifies deposit receipt
3. Platform mints equivalent tokens to investor address
4. Investor uses tokens for asset purchases

**Token-to-fiat (Redemptions):**

1. Investor requests redemption via platform
2. Platform burns tokens from investor address
3. Treasury initiates wire transfer to investor bank
4. Investor receives fiat

### Reconciliation

Ensure fiat and token balances align:

**Discrepancy resolution:**

If balances don't match:

- Review unmatched wire transfers

**Frequency:** Perform reconciliation daily before processing new
deposits/redemptions.

## Common workflows

### Handle multi-currency conversions

Process deposits in different fiat currencies:

1. Investor wires EUR to EUR bank account
2. Record deposit in EUR
3. Configure EUR/USD exchange rate:
   - Navigate to **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Exchange Rates**
   - Enter current EUR/USD rate
   - Or enable automated rates via API
4. Platform calculates token mint:
   - EUR deposit × EUR/USD rate = USD equivalent
   - USD equivalent / peg ratio = tokens to mint
5. Mint USD stablecoin tokens

**Exchange rates:** Update rates daily or integrate live rate feed for accuracy.

### Process large institutional deposits

Handle deposits exceeding standard limits:

For wire &gt; daily limit:

1. Institutional investor requests large deposit
2. Pre-approve large deposit:
   - Navigate to **Fiat Bridge** &gt; **Pre-approvals**
   - Click **Pre-approve Deposit**
   - Enter investor address and amount
   - Set temporary limit override
   - Confirm pre-approval
3. Investor wires fiat
4. Deposit processed normally with override in effect
5. Pre-approval expires after processing

**AML compliance:** Enhanced due diligence required for large deposits
(&gt;$50,000 typical threshold).

### Refund failed deposit

Return fiat for deposits that cannot be processed:

If deposit fails compliance or has issues:

1. Navigate to failed deposit record
2. Click **Initiate Refund**
3. Enter refund reason
4. Confirm refund
5. Process wire transfer back to sender
6. Mark deposit as refunded

**Refund fees:** Inform investor of potential wire fees for refund processing.

### Handle redemption delays

Manage redemptions exceeding settlement time:

If wire transfer delayed:

1. Navigate to delayed redemption
2. Click **Update Status**
3. Select status: "Payment in progress"
4. Enter estimated completion date
5. Send notification to investor
6. Monitor wire completion
7. Mark as paid when complete

**Communication:** Proactive updates reduce investor support inquiries.

## Best practices

**Deposit processing:**

- Process verified deposits within settlement period (T+0, T+1)
- Reconcile bank account before end of business day
- Maintain audit trail of all deposit verifications
- Use unique reference codes for every deposit
- Automate deposit matching where possible

**Redemption processing:**

- Verify banking details against KYC records 100% of time
- Process redemptions in strict order (first-in-first-out)
- Maintain sufficient bank balance for redemption liability
- Monitor redemption queue to prevent backlogs
- Honor stated settlement periods to maintain trust

**Reconciliation:**

- Perform daily reconciliation without fail
- Investigate discrepancies immediately (don't accumulate)
- Maintain 3-way reconciliation: bank, blockchain, platform database
- Document all discrepancy resolutions
- Monthly reconciliation review with accounting team

**Security:**

- Implement dual approval for large redemptions (&gt;$50,000)
- Use separate bank accounts for bridge operations
- Monitor for unusual deposit/redemption patterns
- Screen all transactions against sanctions lists
- Maintain secure storage of wire confirmation numbers

## Results

After completing these steps, you will have:

- Configured fiat bridge with your banking details and stablecoin settings
- Established operational parameters for deposits and redemptions
- Processed fiat deposits and minted tokens to investor wallets
- Handled redemption requests and executed fiat payouts
- Implemented monitoring and reconciliation procedures

Your fiat bridge is now operational and can handle investor fiat-to-token
conversions and token-to-fiat redemptions. Daily operations involve verifying
deposits, approving redemptions, processing payouts, and reconciling balances.

## Troubleshooting

**Deposit not appearing in pending queue:**

- Verify wire transfer completed (check bank account)
- Check reference code in wire memo matches format
- Ensure deposit amount meets minimum threshold
- Manually record deposit if automated matching failed

**Cannot mint tokens for verified deposit:**

- Check the investor has a verified OnchainID
- Verify the investor is not on a blocklist or sanctions list
- Ensure the stablecoin contract has sufficient mint capacity
- Confirm the platform has SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE on the token

**Redemption request rejected by platform:**

- Verify the investor holds sufficient token balance
- Check the investor's banking details are complete
- Ensure the token allows redemptions (not paused)
- Verify the investor meets minimum redemption amount

**Wire transfer failed or returned:**

- Verify banking details are accurate (IBAN, SWIFT, account number)
- Check beneficiary name matches the bank account
- Ensure the bank account accepts international wires
- Contact the investor for updated banking information

**Reconciliation shows discrepancy:**

- Review unmatched deposits in your bank statement
- Check for manual mints not recorded in the bridge system
- Verify all redemption payouts are marked as complete
- Look for duplicate entries in the bridge database
