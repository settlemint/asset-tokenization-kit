## Overview

You've deployed the platform and completed onboarding. Now you're responsible
for enabling asset types, assigning operational roles, deploying yield
automation, and maintaining system health. This guide walks through Day 1
configuration and ongoing administrative tasks that keep your tokenization
platform running.

**Primary role:** Platform administrators, DevOps engineers

**Secondary readers:** System operators, IT managers responsible for platform
configuration and maintenance

## Before you start

Make sure you have:

- Platform admin role with multisig wallet access
- Completed system deployment during onboarding
- Organizational role matrix documenting segregation of duties
- Gas budget allocated for factory deployments

**Time required:** Initial configuration 45-90 minutes; ongoing monitoring is
continuous with weekly reviews

## Day 1 scenario: setting up production access

Your platform is deployed to mainnet. The deployment wallet holds platform admin
rights, but you need to establish operational role segregation before your
treasury team can issue bonds and your compliance team can manage investor
identities.

First priority: distribute platform-level permissions to operational wallets
using multisig governance. This prevents single points of failure and
establishes audit trails. You'll assign three platform roles—Platform Admin,
Identity Manager, and Claim Issuer—then enable the Bond asset type factory.
Because bonds require automated coupon payments, you'll deploy the Yield addon
factory. Finally, you'll configure observability dashboards to track factory
usage and role activity.

## Access admin settings

Navigate to administrative controls by logging in with your platform
administrator account. Click **Platform Settings** in the left sidebar. The
administrative dashboard appears with five configuration sections: access
control for role assignments, asset types showing enabled factories, addon
modules for yield automation, claim topics defining identity requirements, and
theme customization for branding.

Only wallets holding platform administrator roles can see these settings. If the
settings page doesn't appear, verify your wallet address against the initial
deployment configuration.

## Establish role segregation

Role-based access control (RBAC) separates operational responsibilities across
teams. Platform-level roles govern system-wide permissions, while token-level
roles apply to individual assets after deployment.

### Platform-level roles

Three roles control platform operations. **Platform Admin** holds full system
administrator privileges including factory deployment and role assignment.
**Identity Manager** controls the identity registry, managing investor
onboarding and KYC claim verification. **Claim Issuer** signs identity claims
that authorize investors for specific asset types or jurisdictions.

Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Permissions** to view current role
assignments. The users table shows wallet addresses, assigned roles, and
assignment timestamps. Role changes emit on-chain events visible in the **Access
Control** dashboard.
Table filters and search terms persist in the URL, letting compliance share
direct links to pre-filtered user views without rebuilding the table state.

### Token-level roles

After deploying an asset (bond, equity, fund), you assign four operational roles
per token. **GOVERNANCE_ROLE** configures compliance rules and transfer
restrictions. **SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE** mints new tokens during subscriptions
and burns during redemptions. **CUSTODIAN_ROLE** freezes investor accounts
during legal holds and recovers tokens when required. **EMERGENCY_ROLE** pauses
all transfers during security incidents.

These roles appear during token deployment. You'll assign them in the asset
creation workflow documented in asset-specific issuance guides.

### Assigning platform roles with multisig governance

Distribute platform roles to operational teams while maintaining security
controls. Platform Admin should go to 2-3 senior administrators using a 2-of-3
multisig wallet (never a single-signature wallet). Identity Manager goes to your
compliance team, typically 1-2 members who handle investor onboarding. Claim
Issuer goes to your KYC provider integration or internal compliance system.

Use your organization's access management system (Safe, Defender, or custom
governance contract) to grant these roles. Each role assignment creates an
on-chain event that feeds the observability stack. Check the **Role
Assignments** panel in the admin dashboard after granting permissions to verify
events appear within 30 seconds.

**Why multisig matters:** Single-signature admin wallets create catastrophic
failure points. If the private key is compromised or lost, you lose platform
control. A 2-of-3 multisig requires two approvals for factory deployments or
emergency actions, creating accountability and preventing unilateral mistakes.

Review role assignments quarterly. Revoke access when team members change
positions or leave the organization. Maintain a role assignment matrix
documenting who holds which permissions and why.

## Enable asset type factories

Asset type factories deploy new tokens on demand. During onboarding, you
selected which asset types to enable (bonds, equities, funds, stablecoins,
deposits). If you need to enable additional asset types post-deployment, use the
factory enablement workflow.

Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Asset Types**. The registry shows five
asset types with their factory contract addresses, deployment counts, and
status. Enabled factories show the proxy address and current token count.
Disabled types show an **Enable Asset Type** button.

### Enabling a new asset type

Suppose your platform initially launched with equity and fund support, but
treasury operations now require bond issuance. You need to deploy the Bond
factory.

Click **Enable Asset Type** next to Bonds. The deployment modal shows factory
parameters: implementation contract address (pre-deployed during platform
setup), proxy configuration, and gas cost estimate. During low network
congestion (weekends or late UTC evenings), gas costs drop 40-60% compared to
peak hours.

Enter your PIN or OTP when prompted. Click **Deploy Factory**. The platform
executes three transactions: deploying the factory implementation contract,
deploying the factory proxy, and registering the factory in the factory
registry. The entire sequence takes 60-90 seconds on typical EVM networks.

After deployment completes, the Bond asset type appears as enabled with a token
count of zero. Navigate to **Asset Issuance** in the main menu; Bonds now
appears as a creation option. Check the **Factory Deployments** dashboard panel
to verify the deployment event appears with transaction hashes and gas
consumption metrics.

**Gas planning:** Factory deployment consumes 2-4 million gas depending on asset
type complexity. Bonds and funds (with yield calculations) use more gas than
stablecoins or deposits. Budget $50-200 per factory at typical gas prices, but
always check current network conditions before deploying.

## Deploy addon modules

Addons extend platform capabilities with optional features. Currently, one addon
type is available: Yield, which automates scheduled interest and dividend
calculations for bonds and funds.

Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Addons**. The registry shows available
addons, their deployment status, and usage statistics. The Yield addon displays
how many tokens currently use yield automation and total distributions
processed.

### Understanding when yield is required

If you enabled Bond tokens during onboarding, the platform automatically
deployed the Yield addon factory. Bonds require scheduled coupon payments;
without the Yield addon, you cannot configure payment schedules during bond
creation.

Equity and fund tokens can optionally use Yield for dividend automation.
Stablecoins and deposits don't require yield functionality (deposits use fixed
maturity redemptions, stablecoins maintain 1:1 peg without yield).

### Deploying the yield addon factory

Suppose you initially deployed only stablecoins, but now need to issue bonds.
Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Addons**, find the Yield addon, and
click **Deploy Factory**. Review addon parameters showing the yield calculation
contract, registry integration, and required permissions.

Click **Confirm Deployment** and enter your PIN or OTP. The platform deploys the
addon factory contract and registers it in the addon registry, taking
approximately 45 seconds. The Yield addon now appears during bond and fund
creation, enabling you to configure payment schedules and automated
distributions.

Check the **Addon Deployments** panel in the observability dashboard. The
deployment event should appear with the factory address and initialization
parameters. Later, when you create bonds with yield schedules, usage metrics
will populate showing active yield configurations and upcoming payment dates.

**Selective deployment saves gas:** Deploy only the addons your asset types
require. If you're running a stablecoin-only platform, skip Yield deployment
entirely. You can always enable it later when business needs change.

## Configure identity claim framework

The compliance layer uses on-chain identity claims to enforce transfer
restrictions. Claims are cryptographic attestations (KYC verified, accredited
investor, jurisdiction approval) signed by trusted issuers and bound to investor
wallets via the OnchainID registry.

Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Claim Topics &amp; Issuers** to view
the claim framework configuration. Four default claim topics are registered:

| Claim Topic                     | Topic ID | Purpose                                |
| ------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| CLAIM_TOPIC_KYC                 | 1        | Identity verification completed        |
| CLAIM_TOPIC_ACCREDITED_INVESTOR | 2        | Qualified investor status              |
| CLAIM_TOPIC_JURISDICTION        | 3        | Approved geographic region             |
| CLAIM_TOPIC_INVESTOR_TYPE       | 4        | Institutional vs retail classification |

When you configure compliance rules during asset deployment, you'll require
specific claim topics. For example, a Reg D equity offering might require claims
1, 2, and 3 (KYC + accredited + US jurisdiction). The identity registry checks
these claims before allowing transfers.

### Trusted claim issuers

The platform pre-registers one claim issuer: your internal platform claim issuer
wallet. This issuer can sign all four claim topics during investor onboarding.
External KYC provider integrations register additional issuers when you
configure third-party identity verification.

Adding custom claim topics or additional trusted issuers requires smart contract
development. Work with your technical team to deploy claim issuer contracts and
register them via the identity registry governance functions. Changes to the
claim framework emit events tracked in the **Compliance Activity** dashboard.

Check the **Identity Registry** panel to monitor claim issuance rates and
revocations. High revocation rates indicate compliance issues requiring
investigation.

## Set up observability monitoring

After configuring roles, factories, and addons, establish continuous monitoring
to track system health and operational metrics. The platform integrates with the
observability stack (Hasura GraphQL queries, subgraph indexing, and database
analytics) to surface key performance indicators.

### Dashboard tour

Navigate to the main dashboard after logging in as platform administrator. The
admin view shows five panels:

**Factory Activity** tracks token deployments per asset type, showing daily
creation rates and total active tokens. Sudden spikes indicate batch issuance
campaigns or automated processes. Drops to zero suggest operational issues
blocking deployments.

**Role Assignments** displays recent permission changes with timestamps and
acting administrators. Monitor this panel for unauthorized role grants or
unexpected revocations. All changes should correspond to documented team
updates.

**Addon Usage** shows Yield automation metrics: active schedules, upcoming
payment dates, and total distributions processed. Before bond coupon dates,
verify the upcoming payments list includes expected issuances. Missing entries
indicate configuration errors requiring immediate correction.

**Compliance Metrics** aggregates identity claim statistics: total investors
onboarded, pending KYC verifications, and claim revocations. Compare claim
issuance rates against subscription volumes to detect bottlenecks in investor
onboarding.

**Transaction Volume** tracks platform-wide transfer activity, showing daily
transaction counts per asset type. Correlate volume spikes with known corporate
actions (dividend distributions, redemptions) to validate expected behavior.

### Configuring alerts

Set up threshold alerts for critical metrics. Configure notifications when
factory deployments fail (indicates gas issues or contract bugs), when role
assignment events occur outside maintenance windows (potential security
incidents), or when transaction volumes drop to zero for more than 6 hours
(operational outage).

Alerts integrate with your organization's incident management system (PagerDuty,
Slack, email). Configure alert routing during business hours to on-call
operations teams, and escalate to senior administrators for after-hours critical
events.

Check the **System Health** page weekly to review 7-day trends. Compare current
metrics against historical baselines to detect gradual degradation before it
impacts operations.

## Customize platform appearance

Configure platform branding to match your organization's visual identity.
Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Theme** to customize logos, colors,
typography, and platform images.

### Logos

Configure branding assets for different contexts:

- **Light mode logo** - Full logo with transparent background for light mode
- **Dark mode logo** - Full logo with transparent background for dark mode
- **Light mode icon** - Square icon logo for favicons and compact surfaces in light mode
- **Dark mode icon** - Square icon logo for favicons and compact surfaces in dark mode
- **Logo alt text** - Accessible alt text for screen readers

### Platform images

Configure images for authentication pages and backgrounds:

- **Authentication page image (light mode)** - Optional image displayed on auth pages in light mode
- **Authentication page image (dark mode)** - Optional image displayed on auth pages in dark mode
- **Background image (light mode)** - Background image for authentication pages in light mode
- **Background image (dark mode)** - Background image for authentication pages in dark mode
- **Favicon** - Browser tab icon for the application

### Typography

Select font families and configurations:

- **Sans-serif typeface** - Primary font for UI content
- **Monospace typeface** - Font for code blocks and addresses
- Font source (Default, Google Fonts, or Custom CSS URL)
- Font weights and preloading options

### Color palette

Customize theme colors for light and dark modes:

- Brand colors (text, accent, background gradients)
- State colors (success, warning, error)
- Graphics colors (charts and visualizations)
- Border and shadow colors

**How to upload images:**

1. Navigate to the appropriate section (Logos or Platform Images)
2. Click **Upload file** for the image you want to change
3. Select an image file (SVG, PNG, or WebP recommended)
4. Preview the image in the interface
5. Click **Save** to apply changes across the platform

**Best practices:**

- Use SVG format for logos for best scaling
- Keep file sizes under 5MB
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility
- Test logos on both light and dark backgrounds
- Use consistent branding across all image assets

Changes apply immediately across the platform after saving. Test the appearance across devices (desktop, tablet,
mobile) to verify logo scaling and color contrast meet accessibility standards.

## Ongoing operational workflows

### Weekly health checks

Schedule recurring administrative reviews every Monday morning. Review the
**Factory Activity** panel for unexpected deployment patterns. Check the **Role
Assignments** panel against your documented role matrix to catch drift. Verify
the **Addon Usage** panel shows expected upcoming yield payments matching your
asset calendar. Review the **Compliance Metrics** panel for anomalous claim
revocation rates or KYC processing delays.

Document findings in your operational runbook. Escalate anomalies to technical
teams for investigation.

### Quarterly role audits

Every quarter, export the current role assignment list from the **Permissions**
page. Compare against your organization's access control matrix. Revoke access
for departed team members, update multisig signers when governance membership
changes, and document justification for all platform admin assignments.

Maintain an audit trail linking role grants to HR records or security clearance
documentation. Regulators reviewing your compliance program will request
evidence of least-privilege access control.

### Factory upgrade coordination

When new platform versions deploy upgraded factory implementations, coordinate
with your technical team to execute proxy upgrades during maintenance windows.
Test upgrades in staging environments first, verifying that existing tokens
remain functional and new deployments use updated contract logic.

Schedule upgrades during low-traffic periods (weekends or regional holidays).
Notify asset issuers 48 hours in advance via platform announcements and email.
After upgrades complete, verify the **Factory Activity** dashboard shows
successful post-upgrade deployments before declaring the maintenance window
closed.

## Troubleshooting

**Admin settings page not visible**

Your wallet address lacks the platform administrator role. Verify your wallet
connection shows the correct address (check the wallet icon in the header). If
you're certain the address is correct, contact the deployment team to confirm
role assignment. Check the on-chain role registry via block explorer: search for
the PlatformRoles contract and query the admin role member list.

**Factory deployment fails with "insufficient funds"**

The platform wallet lacks native token balance to pay gas fees. Check the
platform wallet address (visible in **Platform Settings** &gt; **Overview**) on
a block explorer. Transfer sufficient balance to cover deployment costs plus 20%
buffer. Retry factory deployment after confirming balance increase.

**Addon factory deployment reverts with "already deployed"**

The addon factory was deployed during initial onboarding but appears disabled in
the UI. This indicates a UI state synchronization issue. Refresh the browser
page and check the **Addons** panel again. If the addon still shows undeployed,
check the addon registry contract directly via block explorer to confirm
on-chain state. Contact technical support if on-chain state contradicts UI
display.

**Observability dashboards show stale data**

The subgraph indexing layer is behind chain head or experiencing sync issues.
Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **System Status** to check indexer
health. If the indexer shows block lag exceeding 100 blocks, restart the indexer
service. For managed deployments, contact infrastructure support. Check Hasura
console logs for GraphQL query errors indicating database connection issues.

For additional help, see [Troubleshooting](/docs/user-guides/troubleshooting) or
contact platform support with transaction hashes and wallet addresses for
investigation.
