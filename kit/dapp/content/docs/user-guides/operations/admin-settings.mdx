## Overview

Platform administration involves configuring system-wide settings, managing
roles and permissions, deploying addon modules, and maintaining system health.
This guide walks you through platform configuration and operational maintenance.

**Primary role:** Platform administrators, DevOps engineers

**Secondary readers:** System operators, IT managers responsible for platform
configuration and maintenance

## Before you start

Make sure you have:

- Platform admin role with required permissions
- Completed system deployment during onboarding
- Understanding of organizational structure and role assignments
- Familiarity with blockchain networks and gas management

**Time required:** 30-60 minutes for initial configuration; ongoing maintenance
is periodic

## Step 1: Access admin settings

Navigate to administrative controls:

1. Log in to platform with administrator account
2. Click **Platform Settings** in the left sidebar
3. Administrative dashboard appears with configuration sections:
   - Access control
   - Asset types and factories
   - Addon modules
   - Claim topics and issuers
   - Theme customization

**Permission check:** Admin settings are only visible to users with platform
administrator roles.

## Step 2: Manage access control

Configure roles and permissions.

### System roles overview

Platform uses role-based access control (RBAC) with predefined roles:

**Platform-level roles:**

Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Permissions**:

- **Platform Admin** - Full system administrator
- **Identity Manager** - Manage identity registry
- **Claim Issuer** - Issue identity claims

**Token-level roles:**

Assigned per individual token:

- **GOVERNANCE_ROLE** - Token compliance and parameters
- **SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE** - Mint and burn tokens
- **CUSTODIAN_ROLE** - Freeze and recover tokens
- **EMERGENCY_ROLE** - Pause token transfers

### Assign platform roles

Grant platform-level permissions:

1. Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Permissions**
2. Review current role assignments in the users table
3. Use your organization's access management system to grant roles

**Role assignment:**

- Platform Admin: Assign to 2-3 trusted administrators using multisig wallets
- Identity Manager: Assign to compliance team members
- Claim Issuer: Assign to KYC provider or compliance system

**Best practice:** Use multisig wallets for critical roles to prevent
single-point-of-failure.

## Step 3: Manage asset types

Configure which asset types are available.

### Asset type registry

View enabled asset types:

Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Asset Types**:

Platform shows enabled asset types:

- **Bonds** - Debt instruments
- **Equity** - Company shares
- **Funds** - Investment fund units
- **Stablecoins** - Fiat-pegged tokens
- **Deposits** - Certificate of deposit tokens

Each asset type shows:

- Factory contract address
- Number of deployed tokens
- Status (enabled/disabled)

### Enable new asset type

Add asset type to platform:

If asset type was not deployed during onboarding:

1. Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Asset Types**
2. Click **Enable Asset Type** for the desired type
3. Review deployment parameters
4. Enter your PIN or OTP when prompted
5. Click **Deploy Factory**
6. Platform:
   - Deploys factory implementation contract
   - Deploys factory proxy
   - Registers factory in factory registry
   - Enables asset type in platform UI
7. Asset type now available for token creation

**Cost:** Factory deployment consumes gas. Plan deployment during low-congestion
periods.

## Step 4: Manage addon modules

Configure optional platform addons.

### Addon registry

View available addons:

Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Addons**:

Platform shows addon categories:

**Yield distribution:**

- Yield - Automated interest/dividend payments (required for bonds)

**Note:** Additional addon types will be available in future releases.

Each addon shows deployment status and usage statistics.

### Deploy addon factory

Enable addon for platform use:

1. Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Addons**
2. Find addon to deploy (for example, "Yield")
3. Click **Deploy Factory**
4. Review addon parameters and permissions
5. Click **Confirm Deployment**
6. Enter your PIN or OTP when prompted
7. Platform:
   - Deploys addon factory contract
   - Registers in addon registry
   - Makes available in token creation and management UI
8. Addon now available for use with compatible tokens

**Selective deployment:** The Yield addon is automatically selected during
onboarding if you enable Bond tokens, as bonds require yield functionality.

## Step 5: Configure claim topics and issuers

Manage identity claim framework.

### Claim topics

Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Claim Topics & Issuers**:

View registered claim topics:

- CLAIM_TOPIC_KYC (Topic 1)
- CLAIM_TOPIC_ACCREDITED_INVESTOR (Topic 2)
- CLAIM_TOPIC_JURISDICTION (Topic 3)
- CLAIM_TOPIC_INVESTOR_TYPE (Topic 4)

**Add custom claim topic:**

Custom claim topic creation requires smart contract development and deployment.
Contact your technical team for assistance.

### Trusted claim issuers

View registered claim issuers:

- Platform claim issuer (default)
- External KYC provider integrations

**Add trusted issuer:**

Adding trusted issuers requires smart contract configuration. Work with your
technical team to register additional claim issuers.

## Step 6: Customize theme

Configure platform appearance:

Navigate to **Platform Settings** &gt; **Theme**:

You can customize:

- Primary brand color
- Logo upload
- Favicon

Changes apply immediately across the platform.

## Common workflows

### Monitor system health

Track platform metrics:

1. Navigate to dashboard
2. Review key metrics:
   - Total tokens deployed
   - Active users
   - Recent transactions

### Review audit logs

Track system events:

1. Use blockchain explorer to review on-chain events
2. Monitor key contract interactions
3. Track token deployments and transfers

**Event types:**

- User access events
- Role assignment changes
- Token deployments
- Claim issuance/revocation

### Handle system maintenance

Coordinate with your technical team for:

- Contract upgrades
- Network migrations
- Emergency pauses

## Best practices

**Access control:**

- Use multisig wallets for all platform admin roles
- Review role assignments quarterly
- Revoke unnecessary permissions (least privilege)
- Maintain role assignment documentation

**System monitoring:**

- Review platform activity regularly
- Monitor token deployment trends for capacity planning
- Track blockchain node health continuously

**Maintenance:**

- Coordinate platform upgrades with technical team during low-traffic periods
- Test all upgrades in staging environment first
- Document all configuration changes
- Perform quarterly disaster recovery drills

## Troubleshooting

**Cannot access admin settings**

- Verify your address has platform administrator role
- Check wallet connection and network
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Ensure using admin account

**Asset type deployment fails**

- Check sufficient platform balance for factory deployment
- Verify network connectivity
- Review deployment transaction on block explorer
- Retry after network congestion clears

**Addon factory deployment reverts**

- Verify sufficient gas for deployment
- Check network status
- Ensure addon compatible with system version
- Review transaction revert reason on block explorer
