Equity tokens represent ownership shares in a company with optional voting
rights, dividend distributions, and shareholder governance capabilities. This
guide walks you through deploying compliant equity tokens from configuration
through shareholder operations.

**Who should read this:** Corporate secretaries, CFOs, investor relations teams,
and startup founders tokenizing company shares or fund units.

**Time required:** 15-20 minutes for equity deployment; additional time for
governance configuration.

**Prerequisites:**

- Completed [Getting started](/docs/user-guides/getting-started) onboarding
- Equity system factory deployed during onboarding
- Shareholder agreement and cap table prepared
- Regulatory framework determined (Reg D, Reg S, Reg A, or custom)

## Step 1: Navigate to equity creation

From the main dashboard:

1. Click **Asset Management** in the left sidebar
2. Select **Equity** from the asset type list
3. Click **Create New Equity Token** button

![Equity creation navigation](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Asset Management section showing Equity category with existing equity tokens
list and Create New Equity Token button_

## Step 2: Configure token parameters

### Basic token information

Enter standard token details:

- **Token name** - Full legal name (e.g., "TechStartup Inc. Series A Preferred")
- **Token symbol** - Trading symbol (e.g., "TECH-A")
- **Decimals** - Token divisibility (0 for whole shares, 18 for fractional
  ownership)
- **Initial supply** - Number of shares to mint at deployment (or 0 to mint
  later)

![Equity basic information](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Equity configuration form showing name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply
fields with validation_

**Naming guidance:** Use descriptive names that indicate share class (Common,
Preferred, Series A/B/C) for cap table clarity.

### Share class configuration

Define equity class properties:

**Share class type**

Select class:

- **Common Stock** - Standard ownership shares with voting rights
- **Preferred Stock** - Priority shares with special rights
- **Fund Units** - Investment fund ownership interests

**Voting rights**

Configure governance participation:

1. **Enable voting** - Toggle voting capabilities on/off
2. **Voting weight** - Set votes per share (typically 1:1)
3. **Quorum requirements** - Minimum participation for valid votes (optional)

![Share class configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Share class settings showing class type dropdown, voting toggle, and voting
weight input_

**Common vs. Preferred:** Common stock typically has voting rights; preferred
stock may have none or limited votes but includes liquidation preferences.

### Cap table integration

Link to existing cap table:

- **Total authorized shares** - Maximum issuable shares (sets supply cap)
- **Par value** - Nominal value per share (if applicable)
- **Valuation reference** - Latest company valuation (for NAV tracking)

The platform uses this data to enforce cap table limits and calculate ownership
percentages.

## Step 3: Configure compliance framework

Equity tokens enforce transfer restrictions based on securities laws.

### Regulatory framework selection

Choose applicable regulatory framework:

- **Regulation D (506b/506c)** - US private placement (accredited investors)
- **Regulation S** - Offshore offering (non-US investors)
- **Regulation A+** - Mini-IPO (broader investor base with disclosure)
- **Regulation CF** - Crowdfunding (small investors, investment limits)
- **Custom** - Define custom compliance for non-US jurisdictions

![Compliance framework selection](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Regulatory framework cards showing Reg D, Reg S, Reg A+, Reg CF,
and Custom options with descriptions and investor limits_

### Configure compliance modules

Based on selected framework, configure modules:

**Investor eligibility**

Set OnchainID claim requirements:

- **Accredited investor** status (required for Reg D 506c)
- **Qualified purchaser** status (for certain funds)
- **Income/net worth verification** (for crowdfunding limits)
- **KYC/AML verification** level

**Transfer restrictions**

Configure share transfer rules:

- **Right of first refusal (ROFR)** - Company approval required for secondary
  transfers
- **Lock-up period** - Restrict sales for vesting schedule (e.g., 12-month
  cliff)
- **Shareholder approval** - Require board consent for transfers above threshold
- **Maximum holders limit** - Cap total shareholder count (e.g., 499 for
  avoiding SEC registration)

![Compliance modules configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg)
_Screenshot: Compliance modules showing Investor Eligibility, Transfer
Restrictions, and Lock-up Period panels with configuration options_

**Reg D special considerations:** 506(b) allows up to 35 non-accredited
investors; 506(c) requires all investors be accredited with verification.

### Geographic restrictions

Limit share ownership by jurisdiction:

1. Enable **Country Allow List** module
2. Select permitted countries
3. Or enable **Country Block List** for restricted jurisdictions

Regulation S typically excludes US investors; Regulation D restricts to US only.

## Step 4: Set up governance (if voting enabled)

Configure on-chain voting for shareholder decisions.

### Governance parameters

Define voting mechanics:

**Voting power calculation**

- **One token = one vote** - Standard democratic voting
- **Weighted voting** - Different classes have different vote multipliers
- **Snapshot-based** - Voting power determined by holdings at proposal creation

The platform uses ERC20Votes standard for checkpoint-based voting power
tracking.

**Proposal settings**

Configure proposal lifecycle:

- **Proposal threshold** - Minimum tokens required to create proposal
- **Voting period** - Duration proposals remain open (e.g., 7 days)
- **Execution delay** - Timelock before approved proposals execute
- **Quorum** - Minimum participation required for validity

![Governance configuration](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Governance settings showing voting power model, proposal threshold, voting
period, and quorum inputs_

**Best practice:** Set quorum at 20-40% of outstanding shares to balance
engagement with practical governance.

### Delegation support

Enable vote delegation:

1. Toggle **Allow delegation** on
2. Shareholders can delegate voting power to representatives
3. Delegation recorded on-chain with vote checkpoints
4. Delegates vote with combined power

Useful for shareholder representatives or proxy voting services.

## Step 5: Assign operational roles

Grant permissions for equity management:

### Role assignments

Assign addresses to equity-specific roles:

**GOVERNANCE_ROLE**

Manages compliance and corporate governance:

- Configure compliance modules
- Manage shareholder eligibility
- Create governance proposals
- Update share class parameters

Typically assigned to: Corporate secretary or board representative wallet

**SUPPLY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE**

Controls share issuance and buybacks:

- Mint new shares (authorized issuance)
- Burn shares (buybacks, cancellations)
- Batch operations for cap table updates

Typically assigned to: CFO or treasury wallet

**CUSTODIAN_ROLE**

Handles shareholder account operations:

- Freeze compromised accounts
- Execute forced transfers (court orders)
- Recover lost shares

Typically assigned to: Transfer agent wallet

**EMERGENCY_ROLE**

Emergency interventions:

- Pause all transfers
- Unpause after incident resolution

Typically assigned to: Security operations wallet

![Role assignment interface](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Role assignment form showing four roles with address inputs, role descriptions,
and permission lists_

**Separation of duties:** Use different multisig wallets for each role to
prevent single-point-of-failure.

## Step 6: Review and deploy

### Pre-deployment checklist

Verify configuration:

- [ ] Token name and symbol match cap table
- [ ] Share class type correct (Common/Preferred)
- [ ] Total authorized shares set correctly
- [ ] Voting configuration matches shareholder agreement
- [ ] Compliance framework aligns with regulatory filing
- [ ] All operational roles assigned to secure wallets
- [ ] Initial supply amount confirmed

![Deployment summary review](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:

and roles in organized sections_

### Deploy equity contract

Execute deployment:

1. Click **Deploy Equity Token**
2. Review transaction details
3. Enter your PIN or OTP for authentication
4. Confirm transaction

The platform:

1. Deploys equity proxy contract (15-20 seconds)
2. Initializes with your parameters (10 seconds)
3. Configures voting checkpoints (if enabled) (5 seconds)
4. Assigns roles to specified addresses (5 seconds per role)
5. Registers with identity registry (10 seconds)

Total deployment time: 60-90 seconds

![Deployment progress](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:

and timestamps_

## Step 7: Post-issuance actions

After successful deployment:

### Verify deployment

1. Note the contract address
2. Click **View Equity Token** to navigate to details page
3. Verify configuration:
   - Token information correct
   - Share class parameters match
   - Voting enabled (if configured)
   - Roles assigned correctly

![Equity details overview](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:

and shareholder distribution_

### Issue initial allocation

If you deployed with zero initial supply:

1. Prepare founder and investor allocations
2. Navigate to **Actions** tab
3. Click **Mint Shares**
4. Enter recipient addresses and amounts
5. Click **Execute Batch Mint**

**Vesting setup:** For shares with vesting schedules, mint to vesting contract
addresses rather than directly to shareholders.

### Configure vesting schedules (optional)

For founder or employee shares with vesting:

1. Navigate to **Addons** section
2. Deploy **Vesting Airdrop** addon for each vesting schedule
3. Configure:
   - Vesting start date
   - Cliff period (e.g., 12 months)
   - Vesting duration (e.g., 48 months total)
   - Linear vs. milestone vesting
4. Mint shares to vesting contract
5. Add beneficiaries with allocation amounts

Shares release according to vesting schedule automatically.

## Step 8: Manage shareholder operations

### Track cap table

Monitor ownership structure:

1. Navigate to **Shareholders** tab
2. Review current holders:
   - Address and identity
   - Share count
   - Ownership percentage
   - Voting power
   - Acquisition date
3. Export cap table as CSV for reporting

![Shareholder cap table](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:
Shareholders tab showing table with columns for address, identity, shares held,
percentage, voting power, and acquisition date_

**Real-time accuracy:** Cap table updates instantly with each transfer; no
reconciliation delays.

### Process share transfers

Handle secondary transfers with approval workflow:

**For transfers requiring approval:**

1. Shareholder initiates transfer via dApp
2. Transfer enters pending state
3. Navigate to **Pending Transfers** section
4. Review transfer details:
   - Sender and recipient
   - Share amount
   - Compliance status
   - ROFR implications
5. Click **Approve** or **Reject** with reason

**Compliance automation:** Platform auto-rejects transfers where recipient lacks
required claims or violates transfer restrictions.

### Create governance proposals

For equity with voting enabled:

**Create new proposal:**

1. Navigate to **Governance** tab
2. Click **New Proposal**
3. Enter proposal details:
   - Title and description
   - Proposed action (informational or on-chain execution)
   - Voting options (For/Against/Abstain)
   - Voting period
4. Click **Submit Proposal**

**Threshold check:** Your address must hold minimum proposal threshold in
shares.

**Cast votes:**

Shareholders vote on proposals:

1. Navigate to **Governance** &gt; **Active Proposals**
2. Review proposal details
3. Click **Vote**
4. Select option (For/Against/Abstain)
5. Optionally delegate votes
6. Confirm vote transaction

Voting power determined by shares held at proposal creation (checkpoint).

![Governance voting interface](/images/screenshots/placeholder.svg) _Screenshot:

current tally, and vote button_

### Execute dividend distributions

Distribute profits to shareholders:

**For equity with yield addon:**

1. Navigate to **Dividends** tab
2. Click **Schedule Distribution**
3. Configure:
   - Distribution token (USDC, USDT, etc.)
   - Amount per share
   - Payment date
   - Snapshot date (holder eligibility)
4. Fund dividend wallet with total distribution amount
5. Execute distribution on payment date

Distribution happens proportionally based on snapshot holdings.

**Without yield addon:**

Use manual batch transfer or deploy dividend distribution contract.

## Common workflows

### Handle new investor onboarding

Add new shareholder:

1. Investor completes KYC through platform or integrated provider
2. Investor's OnchainID receives required claims
3. Verify investor appears in **Eligible Investors** list
4. Navigate to **Actions** &gt; **Mint Shares**
5. Enter investor address and allocation
6. Execute mint (compliance checks run automatically)

### Process employee share options exercise

Convert options to shares:

1. Employee exercises options (off-chain or via options contract)
2. Navigate to **Actions** &gt; **Mint Shares**
3. Enter employee address and exercised share count
4. Optionally attach to vesting schedule
5. Execute mint

### Execute buyback program

Repurchase shares from shareholders:

1. Obtain shareholder consent for buyback
2. Transfer buyback funds to company treasury
3. Initiate share transfer from shareholder to company wallet
4. Navigate to **Actions** &gt; **Burn Shares**
5. Enter company wallet address and amount to burn
6. Execute burn (reduces total supply)

Record buyback in corporate resolutions.

### Update shareholder eligibility

Modify compliance requirements:

1. Navigate to **Compliance** tab
2. Select module to update (e.g., Country Allow List)
3. Modify parameters (add/remove countries, change claim requirements)
4. Click **Update Module**
5. Requires GOVERNANCE_ROLE

**Impact:** Existing holders grandfathered; new requirements apply to future
transfers only.

## Best practices

**Before deployment:**

- Coordinate with legal counsel to ensure compliance matches offering documents
- Prepare complete cap table with all founder and investor allocations
- Test voting mechanics with sample proposals
- Set up vesting contracts before minting employee shares

**During lifecycle:**

- Maintain shareholder contact information off-chain for proxy materials
- Review compliance module settings quarterly for regulatory updates
- Monitor transfer approval queue daily for pending secondary sales
- Keep governance proposals clear and actionable with specific terms

**Governance operations:**

- Announce proposals via email 48 hours before voting starts
- Set realistic quorum thresholds based on historical participation
- Maintain proposal history for corporate records and audit trails
- Consider snapshot voting off-chain for non-binding advisory votes

## Troubleshooting

**Deployment fails with "Total supply exceeds authorized shares"**

- Verify initial supply less than authorized shares cap
- Check cap configuration includes adequate buffer for future issuance

**Minting fails for investor**

- Verify investor OnchainID registered
- Check investor has all required claims (accredited status, jurisdiction, KYC
  level)
- Confirm investor country not on blocklist
- Ensure total supply after mint does not exceed cap

**Governance proposal creation fails**

- Verify your address holds minimum proposal threshold
- Check voting is enabled in equity configuration
- Ensure proposal parameters within allowed ranges

**Vote transaction reverts**

- Confirm you hold shares at proposal creation checkpoint
- Verify proposal still in voting period (not ended or executed)
- Check you haven't already voted on this proposal

**Dividend distribution fails**

- Verify dividend wallet has sufficient distribution token balance
- Check calculation: (total supply × amount per share) = required balance
- Ensure all eligible holders have verified OnchainIDs
