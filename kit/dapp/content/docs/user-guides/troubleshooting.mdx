platform users. Find quick answers to frequent problems organized by topic area.

## Getting started and onboarding

### Cannot access platform or login fails

**Symptoms:** Login page doesn't load, credentials rejected, or unable to
authenticate.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check browser compatibility:**
   - Use Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari (latest versions)
   - Enable JavaScript
   - Disable ad blockers that may interfere
   - Clear browser cache and cookies

2. **Verify network connection:**
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Ensure firewall not blocking platform domain
   - Try different network (mobile hotspot) to isolate issue

3. **Password issues:**
   - Use **Forgot Password** to reset
   - Check caps lock is off
   - Ensure password meets requirements (if creating new account)

4. **2FA problems:**
   - Verify authenticator app time synchronized
   - Use backup codes if 2FA lost
   - Contact administrator to reset 2FA

**Still not working?** Contact platform support with browser console error
messages (F12 &gt; Console tab).

### Wallet creation fails during onboarding

**Symptoms:** "Wallet creation failed" or wallet deployment transaction reverts.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check network status:**
   - Verify blockchain network operational (check network status page)
   - Wait for network congestion to subside
   - Retry after 5-10 minutes

2. **Browser issues:**
   - Clear site data: Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Site Settings &gt; Clear Data
   - Disable browser extensions temporarily
   - Try incognito/private browsing mode

3. **Platform gas balance:**
   - Ensure platform has sufficient native tokens for deployment
   - Contact administrator if persistent

**Workaround:** Use existing wallet by selecting "Import Wallet" instead of
"Create New".

### OnchainID deployment stuck or fails

**Symptoms:** OnchainID deployment pending forever or transaction fails.

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify wallet has gas:**
   - Although platform pays for deployment, check wallet connection
   - Retry deployment after ensuring wallet connected

2. **Network issues:**
   - Check blockchain explorer for transaction status
   - Transaction may be pending due to low gas price
   - Wait for transaction confirmation or retry

3. **Duplicate OnchainID:**
   - Each address can only have one OnchainID
   - If you already have OnchainID, deployment fails
   - Check if OnchainID already exists on profile page

**Resolution:** Navigate to **Account** &gt; **OnchainID** and click **Retry
Deployment** if status shows failed.

### Cannot complete onboarding - stuck on system deployment step

**Symptoms:** System deployment screen shows indefinite loading or some
contracts fail to deploy.

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait for all deployments:**
   - System deployment takes 3-5 minutes
   - Don't close browser or navigate away
   - Progress bar shows deployment status

2. **Check for failed contracts:**
   - If specific contract fails, note which one
   - Click **Retry Failed Deployments**
   - Contact administrator if repeated failures

3. **Network timeouts:**
   - Slow network may timeout deployments
   - Retry deployment from **Account** &gt; **System Setup**
   - Deployments resume from last successful step

**Critical:** Do not create new account; use **Resume Onboarding** to continue
from checkpoint.

## Wallet and account issues

### Wallet not connecting or disconnecting frequently

**Symptoms:** Wallet connection fails, disconnects randomly, or shows wrong
network.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check wallet installation:**
   - Ensure MetaMask or compatible wallet installed
   - Update wallet to latest version
   - Enable wallet browser extension

2. **Network mismatch:**
   - Verify wallet connected to correct network
   - Platform shows expected network (e.g., "Ethereum Mainnet")
   - Switch network in wallet to match platform

3. **Connection permissions:**
   - Check site permissions in wallet
   - Re-connect wallet via **Connect Wallet** button
   - Clear wallet cache (Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Reset)

4. **Multiple wallets:**
   - Disable other wallet extensions
   - Select correct wallet in connection modal
   - Ensure only one wallet active at a time

### Lost access to wallet or forgot recovery codes

**Symptoms:** Cannot access wallet, recovery codes lost or invalid.

**Solutions:**

1. **Wallet recovery:**
   - Use wallet's seed phrase recovery if available
   - Check password manager for saved recovery codes
   - Look for recovery codes email sent during wallet creation

2. **Request new wallet:**
   - If primary wallet lost, contact platform administrator
   - Administrator can link new wallet to your OnchainID
   - Requires identity verification

3. **Recovery service:**
   - Navigate to **Account** &gt; **Wallet Recovery**
   - Submit recovery request with proof of identity
   - Administrator initiates recovery process

**Prevention:** Always store recovery codes securely offline (not in email or
cloud storage).

### Cannot see wallet balance or transactions not showing

**Symptoms:** Token balance shows zero despite owning tokens, or recent
transactions missing.

**Solutions:**

1. **Refresh balance:**
   - Click **Refresh** button on account page
   - Wait 30 seconds for blockchain sync
   - Check blockchain explorer to verify balance on-chain

2. **Network sync issues:**
   - Platform may be syncing with blockchain
   - Check network status indicator (top right)
   - Wait a few minutes and refresh page

3. **Wrong wallet connected:**
   - Verify correct wallet address connected
   - Check if you have multiple wallets
   - Switch to wallet that holds tokens

4. **Custom token not added:**
   - Platform should automatically display tokens
   - If missing, add token custom contract address in wallet

## Token transactions and transfers

### Token transfer fails or reverts

**Symptoms:** "Transfer failed" message, transaction reverts, or tokens not
arriving at destination.

**Solutions:**

1. **Compliance failures:**
   - **Recipient not verified:** Recipient must have verified OnchainID with
     required claims
   - **Transfer restrictions:** Token may have transfer limits or lock-up
     periods
   - **Blocked address:** Recipient may be on blocklist or sanctions list
   - **Country restrictions:** Recipient country may not be allowed

2. **Insufficient balance:**
   - Verify you hold sufficient token balance
   - Check you're transferring correct token
   - Account for gas costs in native token

3. **Gas issues:**
   - Transaction out of gas
   - Increase gas limit in wallet
   - Retry during lower network congestion

4. **Paused token:**
   - Token transfers may be paused by issuer
   - Check token status on token details page
   - Wait for unpause or contact issuer

**Diagnosis:** Check transaction on blockchain explorer for specific revert
reason.

### Cannot find recipient address or transfer form disabled

**Symptoms:** Transfer button greyed out or recipient address validation fails.

**Solutions:**

1. **Address format:**
   - Ensure recipient address is valid Ethereum address (0x... format)
   - Check address is complete (42 characters including 0x)
   - Verify checksum capitalization correct

2. **Transfer restrictions:**
   - Some tokens prohibit transfers (locked during lock-up period)
   - Check token settings for transferability
   - Contact issuer if transfers should be allowed

3. **Minimum transfer:**
   - Token may have minimum transfer amount
   - Increase transfer amount above minimum

**Workaround:** Use blockchain explorer to verify recipient address exists and
can receive tokens.

### Transfer succeeds but recipient balance not updated

**Symptoms:** Transaction confirmed but recipient doesn't see tokens.

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait for confirmations:**
   - Wait for 3-5 block confirmations
   - Refresh recipient's page
   - Check blockchain explorer for transaction

2. **Wrong network:**
   - Verify sender and recipient on same network
   - Cannot transfer between different chains
   - Use bridge if cross-chain transfer needed

3. **Platform sync delay:**
   - Platform may take few minutes to index transaction
   - Token balance correct on-chain (check explorer)
   - Platform UI updates shortly

**Verification:** Always verify transaction on blockchain explorer for ground
truth.

## Identity and compliance
