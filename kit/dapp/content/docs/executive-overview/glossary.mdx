## Overview

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the executive overview.
Understanding these concepts will help you engage with tokenization discussions
and evaluate platform capabilities.

## Core tokenization concepts

**Asset tokenization** : Converting ownership rights in real-world assets into
digital tokens on a blockchain. The token represents the same legal rights as
traditional instruments but enables instant transfer and automated compliance.

**Blockchain** : A distributed ledger technology where transactions are recorded
in blocks and cryptographically linked. Provides immutable audit trails and
eliminates single points of failure.

**Smart contract** : Self-executing code on a blockchain that automatically
enforces rules and executes transactions when conditions are met. Enables
programmable compliance and automated corporate actions.

**Token** : A digital representation of an asset on a blockchain. Security
tokens represent ownership or financial rights in regulated assets like bonds,
equities, or fund units.

## Compliance and identity

**ERC-3643** : A token standard specifically designed for permissioned
securities. Ensures compliance checks happen before every transfer by linking
tokens to verified identities.

**OnchainID** : A decentralized identity protocol where verified claims about an
investor (KYC status, accreditation, jurisdiction) are cryptographically linked
to their wallet address.

**Identity registry** : A system that maps wallet addresses to verified
identities and eligibility criteria. Only registered addresses can interact with
compliant assets.

**KYC/AML** : Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering procedures required
by regulators. Verifies investor identity and screens against sanctions lists.

**Accredited investor** : An individual or entity meeting financial thresholds
(income, net worth, or sophistication) allowing participation in private
securities offerings under US regulations.

## Platform architecture

**DALP (Digital Asset Lifecycle Platform)** : Unified infrastructure managing
the complete lifecycle of tokenized assets from issuance through redemption.
Integrates compliance, custody, settlement, and servicing in one system rather
than cobbling together multiple vendors.

**SMART Protocol (SettleMint Adaptable Regulated Token)** : The compliance
framework underlying all ATK assets. Extends ERC-3643 with modular compliance
rules and identity management.

**Compliance engine** : The policy enforcement system that evaluates every
transfer against configurable rules before execution. Non-compliant transactions
revert automatically.

**Factory contract** : A smart contract template that deploys new asset tokens
with pre-configured compliance and governance structures, accelerating time to
market.

## Settlement and operations

**T+0 settlement** : Same-day settlement where ownership transfers complete on
the day of the transaction, versus traditional T+2 (two business days after
trade date).

**Atomic settlement / DvP (Delivery versus Payment)** : Simultaneous exchange
where the asset and payment both complete or both fail together, eliminating
counterparty risk during settlement windows.

**Stablecoin** : A cryptocurrency pegged to fiat currency (like USD) at a 1:1
ratio, typically backed by reserves. Enables on-chain payments and settlement.

**Gas fee** : Transaction cost on a blockchain network, paid to validators who
process and confirm transactions.

## Corporate actions

**Coupon payment** : Periodic interest payment on a bond, distributed to all
token holders proportionally to their holdings.

**NAV (Net Asset Value)** : The per-share value of a fund, calculated by
dividing total assets minus liabilities by the number of shares outstanding.

**Cap table** : Capitalization table showing all holders of an asset and their
ownership percentages. Blockchain provides real-time cap table visibility.

**Redemption** : The process of converting tokens back to cash or underlying
assets, typically at maturity for bonds or upon fund exit.

## Regulatory frameworks

**MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets)** : European Union regulation providing
comprehensive framework for crypto-assets including security tokens and
stablecoins.

**Regulation D** : US SEC rule allowing private securities offerings to
accredited investors without full registration requirements.

**Regulation S** : US SEC rule permitting securities offerings outside the
United States without registration, subject to restrictions.

**MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore)** : Singapore's central bank and
financial regulatory authority, which has established clear frameworks for
digital assets.

## Security and custody

**Multi-signature wallet (multisig)** : A wallet requiring multiple private key
signatures to authorize transactions, implementing maker-checker controls and
segregation of duties.

**Hardware Security Module (HSM)** : Tamper-resistant physical device that
securely stores cryptographic keys and performs signing operations, meeting
bank-grade security requirements.

**Role-based access control (RBAC)** : Permission system where user capabilities
are determined by assigned roles, ensuring proper segregation of duties.

**Private key** : Cryptographic secret that controls access to a blockchain
wallet. Losing the private key means losing access to assets permanently.
