## Overview

This section demonstrates how different institutions deploy ATK to tokenize
bonds, funds, real estate, stablecoins, and deposits. Each scenario reflects
actual capabilities the platform delivers today.

**Who should read this:** CFOs, treasurers, product managers, and compliance
officers evaluating tokenization for specific asset classes.

**Business value:** Understand how unified lifecycle infrastructure reduces
time-to-market, operational overhead, and compliance risk across diverse
regulated assets.

## Asset class coverage

The platform handles five primary categories, each with distinct regulatory
requirements and operational workflows:

| Asset class                                                               | Primary use                       | Settlement  | Typical compliance                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **[Corporate Bonds](/docs/executive-overview/use-cases/corporate-bonds)** | Capital raising, debt instruments | Instant     | Accredited investor, transfer restrictions |
| **[Private Equity](/docs/executive-overview/use-cases/private-equity)**   | Fund units, LP servicing          | Instant     | Qualified purchaser, holding periods       |
| **[Real Estate](/docs/executive-overview/use-cases/real-estate)**         | Fractionalized ownership          | Instant     | Securities laws, FIRPTA withholding        |
| **[Stablecoins](/docs/executive-overview/use-cases/stablecoins)**         | Payment rails, treasury           | Instant     | AML/sanctions, reserve attestation         |
| **[Deposit Certificates](/docs/executive-overview/use-cases/deposits)**   | Time deposits, retail banking     | Time-locked | FDIC limits, customer verification         |

## Why unified infrastructure matters

Traditional tokenization projects assemble issuance, compliance, custody,
settlement, and servicing from separate vendors. This creates integration
overhead, data reconciliation delays, and compliance gaps.

ATK provides lifecycle infrastructure out of the box. Quarterly coupon payments
and NAV distributions execute automatically because corporate actions are built
into the asset layer. Compliance checks happen at transfer time because the
SMART Protocol embeds eligibility rules into token logic.

The same core platform handles bonds, funds, real estate, stablecoins, and
deposits. Asset-specific features live in addon modules rather than separate
deployments, reducing operational complexity and accelerating new product
launches.

## Key capabilities across all asset types

- **Embedded compliance** – Transfer restrictions, investor eligibility, and
  geographic limits enforced at the smart contract level
- **Automated corporate actions** – Coupon payments, distributions, redemptions,
  and fee collection execute on schedule without manual processing
- **Real-time cap tables** – Ownership visibility updates instantly as tokens
  transfer, eliminating reconciliation delays
- **Instant settlement** – Atomic finality replaces T+2 or T+5 cycles, reducing
  counterparty risk and capital lockup
- **Audit trails** – Every transaction, compliance check, and lifecycle event
  recorded on-chain for regulatory reporting

## Regulatory considerations

Each asset class navigates distinct frameworks. Bonds typically fall under
securities laws requiring accredited investor verification. Private equity funds
add qualified purchaser thresholds and lock-up periods. Real estate introduces
property transfer rules and tax withholding. Stablecoins face banking
regulations and reserve requirements. Deposits require FDIC compliance and
consumer protection.

The platform adapts to these requirements through configurable compliance
modules rather than hard-coded rules. See
[Compliance & Security](/docs/executive-overview/compliance-security) for
detailed architecture.

## Implementation path

Deploying a use case typically involves:

1. **Asset configuration** – Define terms, compliance rules, and lifecycle
   schedules via the Asset Designer
2. **Investor onboarding** – Integrate KYC/AML providers to verify eligibility
   and issue OnchainID credentials
3. **Primary distribution** – Allocate tokens to verified investors with
   embedded transfer restrictions
4. **Lifecycle automation** – Configure corporate actions (coupons,
   distributions, redemptions) to execute on schedule
5. **Ongoing operations** – Monitor cap tables, handle secondary transfers,
   generate regulatory reports
