## How different institutions use the platform

These scenarios illustrate real workflows that ATK enables today. Names and
specifics are illustrative, but the mechanics and outcomes reflect actual
production capabilities.

The following use cases demonstrate how ATK handles different asset classes and
institutional requirements:

- **[Corporate Bonds](/docs/executive-overview/use-cases/corporate-bonds)** -
  Debt instrument issuance with automated coupon payments and redemption
- **[Private Equity Funds](/docs/executive-overview/use-cases/private-equity)** -
  Fund tokenization with NAV tracking and LP servicing
- **[Real Estate](/docs/executive-overview/use-cases/real-estate)** -
  Fractionalized property ownership with rental income distribution
- **[Stablecoins](/docs/executive-overview/use-cases/stablecoins)** -
  Bank-issued payment infrastructure with reserve management
- **[Deposit Certificates](/docs/executive-overview/use-cases/deposits)** -
  Digital time deposits with FDIC compliance

## Why these scenarios work

These use cases succeed because ATK provides unified lifecycle infrastructure.
You're not cobbling together issuance, compliance, custody, settlement, and
servicing from separate vendors. The platform handles the complete lifecycle,
which is why complex workflows like quarterly coupon payments or NAV
distributions happen automatically instead of requiring manual intervention.

Compliance is embedded at the asset level, not layered on afterward. Bond tokens
only transfer to accredited investors because the eligibility check is in the
transfer path. Fund tokens enforce holding restrictions because the smart
contract implements those rules. Stablecoins enforce monitoring requirements
because compliance modules are part of the architecture.

The platform adapts to different asset classes and regulatory frameworks without
requiring separate deployments. The same infrastructure manages bonds, funds,
real estate, stablecoins, and deposits because the SMART Protocol provides
unified compliance and the addon system handles asset-specific features.

The next section dives deeper into the compliance and security architecture that
enables these use cases to operate with institutional confidence and regulatory
acceptance.
