## Overview

Corporate bond issuance through ATK reduces time-to-market from months to days
while automating ongoing servicing. The platform handles primary distribution,
coupon payments, and redemption with embedded compliance controls.

**Who should read this:** Corporate treasurers, investment bankers, capital
markets teams evaluating faster execution and reduced operational overhead.

**Business value:** Cut issuance timelines by 80%, eliminate transfer agent
fees, calculate quarterly coupon entitlements with on-demand claiming, and gain
real-time cap table visibility.

## Business challenge

MidCorp Industries needs to raise $50 million through a three-year bond
offering. Traditional underwriting involves months of roadshows, weeks of
settlement, and ongoing manual processes for coupon payments and investor
communications.

## How ATK solves it

**ATK's lifecycle management capabilities eliminate manual processes:**

- **DvP settlement** for atomic primary distribution and secondary trading
- **Vault custody** for secure treasury management with multi-signature controls
- **Scheduled yield calculations** for quarterly coupon entitlements without
  manual spreadsheet work

### Configuration and deployment

MidCorp's treasury team uses the Asset Designer to configure a bond token: $50
million principal, 5% annual coupon paid quarterly, three-year maturity, USD
denomination. They select a Regulation D compliance template to limit the
offering to accredited US investors.

The platform generates the smart contract with compliance controls embedded.
**Critically, ATK also deploys a fixed yield schedule contract that will
calculate quarterly coupon entitlements for claim-based distribution** and
connects the bond to the XvP settlement system for atomic trading.

MidCorp uploads their offering memorandum, which gets cryptographically hashed
and linked to the token metadata. Legal documentation remains permanently
associated with the asset.

### Investor onboarding with embedded compliance

Accredited investors connect through the Investor Portal and complete KYC
verification via an integrated provider. Their OnchainID receives an
accreditation claim. Only wallet addresses linked to verified, accredited
identities can receive bond tokens. Non-accredited addresses cannot receive
tokens; transfers revert automatically.

### Primary distribution with DvP settlement

MidCorp allocates tokens to a subscriber list. **Using ATK's XvP settlement
system, investors exchange cash (stablecoins or tokenized deposits) for bond
tokens atomically.** If an investor's payment fails, they don't receive tokens.
If token transfer fails (e.g., compliance violation), payment doesn't leave
their wallet. Both legs execute together or both revert—true delivery versus
payment.

The platform enforces that every recipient meets eligibility requirements,
eliminating risk of non-compliant distribution. Settlement is instant with T+0
finality. No reconciliation required.

### Scheduled coupon calculations via yield schedules

**ATK's fixed yield schedule contract calculates quarterly entitlements without
manual spreadsheet work.** Every quarter, the yield system calculates interest
owed to each holder based on proportional ownership at the snapshot block. Token
holders claim their coupons directly through the smart contract with
cryptographic proof of entitlement.

The platform supports claims through:

- **Tokenized cash settlement** – Token holders claim their distributions when
  stablecoins or tokenized deposits fund the yield wallet
- **Off-chain payment adapters** – Integration with treasury systems for
  traditional wire/ACH settlement (roadmap)
- **Manual approval workflows** – For jurisdictions requiring human review
  before disbursement

**This eliminates the nightmare of calculating payments for hundreds of
investors, generating wire instructions, and reconciling settlements.** The
yield schedule is configured once during issuance; entitlements are calculated
automatically on payment dates, and investors claim their coupons on-demand. No
spreadsheets. No transfer agent. No manual wire transfers.

### Vault custody for treasury operations

**MidCorp's bond proceeds are held in ATK's multi-signature vault** with
configurable approval requirements. Treasury operations require multiple
signatures—no single person can move funds unilaterally. The vault provides:

- **Maker-checker workflows** where one admin proposes and others approve
- **Emergency pause** capabilities to freeze operations if accounts are
  compromised
- **Full audit trails** showing every proposal, approval, and execution
- **Role-based access control** separating operational roles

This provides bank-grade custody without requiring integration with external
custodians.

### Real-time cap table visibility

MidCorp's IR team sees current ownership in real time through the admin
dashboard. No waiting for monthly reports from a transfer agent. When investors
trade bonds on secondary markets (if permitted through ATK's XvP settlement
system with atomic DvP), the cap table updates immediately.

### Maturity and redemption

At three years, the platform handles redemption automatically: bond tokens are
burned, principal plus final interest is distributed, and the issuance concludes
with complete audit trails showing every payment, every holder, and every
compliance check throughout the lifecycle.

## Key capabilities

| Capability                 | Traditional                            | With ATK                                       |

| **Settlement**             | T+2 to T+5                             | Instant atomic finality                        |
| **Coupon processing**      | Manual calculation & wire instructions | Scheduled calculations with on-demand claiming |
| **Cap table updates**      | Monthly from transfer agent            | Real-time on-chain                             |
| **Compliance enforcement** | Post-trade surveillance                | Pre-transfer validation                        |
| **Transfer agent fees**    | Ongoing quarterly fees                 | Eliminated                                     |

## Measurable outcomes

**Time savings** – Illustrative deployments reduce issuance timelines from 8-12
weeks to under two weeks by eliminating roadshow logistics and settlement
delays.

**Cost reduction** – Transfer agent fees for ongoing servicing are eliminated.
Legal review time decreases because compliance templates are pre-vetted.
Operations overhead drops as corporate actions execute automatically.

**Secondary market liquidity** – Instant settlement enables institutional
investors to trade positions knowing finality arrives in minutes rather than
days.

**Compliance certainty** – Zero non-compliant transfers because only verified
accredited investors can hold tokens. Transfer restrictions are enforced at the
smart contract level.

## Compliance considerations

Bond tokens operate under securities regulations requiring:

- **Accredited investor verification** – Enforced via OnchainID claims before
  token transfer
- **Transfer restrictions** – Lock-up periods, ROFR rights, and volume limits
  configured in compliance modules
- **Jurisdiction controls** – Geographic restrictions via country allow/block
  lists
- **Audit trails** – Every transaction, compliance check, and lifecycle event
  recorded on-chain

For detailed compliance architecture, see
[Compliance & Security](/docs/executive-overview/compliance-security).

## Implementation checklist

1. Define bond terms (principal, coupon rate, maturity, currency)
2. Select compliance template (Reg D, Reg S, or custom ruleset)
3. Integrate KYC/AML provider for investor verification
4. Configure payment adapter for coupon distributions (tokenized cash or
   off-chain settlement)
5. Upload offering documents and link to token metadata
6. Deploy smart contract and conduct primary distribution
7. Configure coupon scheduler and test distribution workflow
8. Set up admin dashboard access for IR and operations teams
