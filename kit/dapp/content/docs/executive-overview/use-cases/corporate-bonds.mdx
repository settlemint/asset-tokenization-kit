## The scenario

MidCorp Industries needs to raise $50 million through a three-year bond
offering. Traditional underwriting would take months of roadshows, weeks of
settlement, and ongoing manual processes for coupon payments and investor
communications. They want faster execution, broader access, and automated
servicing.

## How ATK handles it

**Term sheet to deployment in days**: MidCorp's treasury team uses the Asset
Designer to configure a bond token: $50 million principal, 5% annual coupon paid
quarterly, three-year maturity, USD denomination. They select Regulation D
compliance template to limit the offering to accredited US investors.

The platform generates the smart contract with compliance controls embedded.
MidCorp uploads their offering memorandum, which gets cryptographically hashed
and linked to the token metadata. The legal documentation lives permanently with
the asset.

**Investor onboarding with built-in compliance**: Accredited investors connect
through the Investor Portal and complete KYC verification via an integrated
provider. Their OnchainID gets updated with an accreditation claim. Only wallet
addresses linked to verified, accredited identities can receive bond tokens.

**Primary distribution**: MidCorp allocates tokens to a subscriber list. The
platform enforces that every recipient meets eligibility requirements.
Non-accredited addresses simply cannot receive tokens; the transfer reverts
automatically. No risk of accidental non-compliant distribution.

**Automated quarterly coupons**: Every quarter on the coupon date, the platform
calculates interest owed to each holder based on their proportional ownership.
Using integrated payment rails or tokenized cash, it distributes payments
automatically. Every holder receives their exact amount without manual
calculations or wire transfer instructions.

**Real-time cap table visibility**: MidCorp's IR team sees current ownership in
real time. No waiting for monthly reports from a transfer agent. When investors
trade bonds on secondary markets (if permitted), the cap table updates
immediately.

**Maturity and redemption**: At three years, the platform automatically handles
redemption: bond tokens get burned, principal plus final interest gets
distributed, and the issuance concludes with complete audit trails showing every
payment, every holder, every compliance check throughout the lifecycle.

**Time savings**: Traditional bond issuance took 8-12 weeks from term sheet to
first settlement. With ATK, MidCorp went live in 10 days.

**Cost reduction**: Eliminated transfer agent fees for ongoing servicing,
reduced legal review time because compliance templates are pre-vetted, cut
operations overhead because corporate actions are automated.

**Broader access**: Secondary markets emerged because settlement happens
instantly. Institutional investors could trade positions knowing settlement
completes in minutes, not days.

**Compliance certainty**: Zero non-compliant transfers because only verified
accredited investors could hold tokens. Regulatory comfort increased
dramatically.
