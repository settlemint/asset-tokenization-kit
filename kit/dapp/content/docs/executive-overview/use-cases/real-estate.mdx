## Overview

Real estate tokenization through ATK democratizes access to
institutional-quality properties while automating rental income distributions
and maintaining compliance controls. The platform handles fractionalized
ownership, expense tracking, and property governance.

**Who should read this:** Real estate sponsors, property managers, and asset
managers exploring fractional ownership models.

**Business value:** Lower minimum investment thresholds, automate monthly rental
distributions, enable secondary liquidity, and provide real-time performance
visibility to investors.

## Business challenge

Highland Properties owns a $25 million office building in a major market. They
want to fractionalize ownership to enable smaller investors to participate while
maintaining professional property management and compliance controls.

## How ATK solves it

### Property tokenization as equity

Highland creates 250,000 equity tokens, each representing $100 of building
ownership. Token holders receive proportional rental income distributions and
can participate in governance decisions on major property matters.

### Investor eligibility and documentation

The platform enforces that only verified investors with appropriate
accreditation levels can purchase tokens. Property documents—purchase
agreements, operating agreements, building inspections, insurance policies—are
hashed and linked to the token metadata for permanent transparency.

### Fractional ownership

Investors can purchase as few as 10 tokens ($1,000 investment) or as many as
they want up to regulatory limits. The platform enforces maximum ownership
percentages via compliance modules to maintain distributed ownership.

### Rental income distributions

Monthly rental income from tenants flows into Highland's treasury. After
deducting property management fees and reserves, the platform distributes net
income proportionally to all token holders. Distributions execute automatically
on a preset schedule via configured payment adapters.

### Property expenses and reserves

Major repairs or capital improvements require approval from token holders.
Highland creates a governance proposal using the governance addon module. Token
holders vote with their holdings weighted proportionally.

Note: The current platform supports proposal creation and voting infrastructure.
Property-specific UI workflows (proposal templates for repairs, capital
improvements, special assessments) require custom dapp development or use of
third-party governance tools integrated with the token contract.

### Valuation updates

Annual appraisals update the property's value through the admin portal,
adjusting the implied token value. Holders see current valuations without
requesting reports.

### Compliance with securities and real estate law

The platform enforces both securities regulations (accredited investor
requirements) and applicable real estate regulations (ownership transfer
restrictions, FIRPTA withholding for foreign investors via compliance modules).

### Exit mechanisms

When Highland eventually sells the building, sale proceeds distribute
automatically to all holders proportionally. Tokens are redeemed and the holding
concludes with complete documentation of every income distribution, every
expense, and every ownership change.

## Key capabilities

| Capability                  | Traditional               | With ATK                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Minimum investment**      | $25M (full ownership)     | $1,000 (10 tokens)                  |
| **Distribution processing** | Days of manual wire work  | Automated monthly schedule          |
| **Ownership visibility**    | Quarterly reports         | Real-time dashboard                 |
| **Governance voting**       | Email/phone campaigns     | Token-weighted on-chain proposals   |
| **Secondary transfers**     | Must sell entire property | Trade tokens with compliance checks |
| **Expense tracking**        | Spreadsheets              | On-chain transaction records        |

## Measurable outcomes

**Democratized access** – Real estate institutional-quality investment becomes
available to smaller investors who cannot deploy $25 million for full ownership.

**Operational streamlining** – Distribution processing that used to take days of
manual work now happens automatically each month via configured payment
workflows.

**Transparency** – Investors see property performance, expenses, and income in
real time rather than waiting for quarterly reports.

**Secondary market** – Token holders can sell positions to other qualified
investors, creating liquidity in a traditionally illiquid asset class.

## Compliance considerations

Real estate tokens operate under both securities and property regulations:

- **Accredited investor verification** – Enforced via OnchainID claims
- **Maximum ownership limits** – Configured via compliance modules to maintain
  distributed ownership
- **Transfer restrictions** – Lock-up periods, holding requirements
- **FIRPTA withholding** – For foreign investor transactions (requires custom
  tax module integration)
- **State securities laws** – Multi-state registration compliance

For detailed compliance architecture, see
[Compliance & Security](/docs/executive-overview/compliance-security).

## Implementation checklist

1. Structure property ownership vehicle (LLC, Delaware Statutory Trust, etc.)
2. Define token economics (total supply, price per token, minimum/maximum
   holdings)
3. Select compliance template (Reg D, Reg A+, or custom ruleset)
4. Integrate KYC/AML provider for investor verification
5. Configure rental distribution schedule and payment adapters
6. Set up governance addon for proposal creation and voting
7. Upload property documents (appraisals, insurance, operating agreements) and
   link to metadata
8. Deploy smart contract and conduct primary token sale
9. Configure expense tracking and reserve management workflows

## Limitations and considerations

- **Governance UI** – Platform provides proposal registry and voting
  infrastructure; property-specific workflows (repair proposals, capital
  improvement templates) may require custom dapp development
- **Rental data source** – Income and expense data entered manually via admin
  portal; integration with property management systems requires custom API
  development
- **Regulatory complexity** – Multi-state securities registration and
  property-specific regulations require legal counsel review

## Next steps

- Review [SMART Protocol architecture](/docs/architecture/smart-protocol) to
  understand embedded compliance
- Explore [Developer Documentation](/docs/developer-guides) for governance addon
  customization
