## The scenario

Highland Properties owns a $25 million office building in a major market. They
want to fractionalize ownership to enable smaller investors to participate while
maintaining professional property management and compliance controls.

### Traditional approach

## How ATK handles it

**Property tokenization as equity**: Highland creates 250,000 equity tokens,
each representing $100 of building ownership. Token holders receive proportional
rental income distributions and have voting rights on major property decisions.

**Investor eligibility and documentation**: The platform enforces that only
verified investors with appropriate accreditation levels can purchase tokens.
Property documents—purchase agreements, operating agreements, building
inspections, insurance policies—are hashed and linked to the token metadata for
permanent transparency.

**Fractional ownership**: Investors can purchase as few as 10 tokens ($1,000
investment) or as many as they want up to regulatory limits. The platform
enforces maximum ownership percentages to maintain distributed ownership.

**Rental income distributions**: Monthly rental income from tenants flows into
Highland's treasury. After deducting property management fees and reserves, the
platform distributes net income proportionally to all token holders.
Distributions happen automatically on a preset schedule.

**Property expenses and reserves**: Major repairs or capital improvements
require approval from token holders. Highland creates a governance proposal
through the platform. Token holders vote with their holdings weighted
proportionally. Approved expenses draw from reserves or trigger special
assessments distributed fairly among holders.

**Valuation updates**: Annual appraisals update the property's value in the
platform, adjusting the implied token value. Holders see current valuations
without requesting reports.

**Compliance with securities and real estate law**: The platform enforces both
securities regulations (accredited investor requirements) and any applicable
real estate regulations (ownership transfer restrictions, FIRPTA withholding for
foreign investors).

**Exit mechanisms**: When Highland eventually sells the building, sale proceeds
distribute automatically to all holders proportionally. Tokens are redeemed and
the holding concludes with complete documentation of every income distribution,
every expense, and every ownership change.

**Democratized access**: Real estate institutional-quality investment became
available to smaller investors who couldn't deploy $25 million.

**Operational streamlining**: Distribution processing that used to take days of
manual work now happens automatically each month.

**Transparency**: Investors see property performance, expenses, and income in
real time rather than waiting for quarterly reports.

**Secondary market**: Token holders could sell positions to other qualified
investors, creating liquidity in an traditionally illiquid asset class.
