## Overview

Private equity fund tokenization through ATK automates LP servicing, NAV
tracking, and distribution processing. The platform reduces fund administration
costs while enabling secondary liquidity for limited partners.

**Who should read this:** General partners, fund administrators, and investor
relations teams managing institutional LP relationships.

**Business value:** Cut fund administration costs by 60%, enable real-time
performance visibility, automate distributions, and facilitate compliant
secondary transfers.

## Business challenge

Apex Capital runs a $200 million venture fund with 80 institutional LPs.
Traditional fund administration is expensive, slow, and opaque. Quarterly
valuations take weeks to calculate and distribute. Capital calls and
distributions require manual processing. Secondary transfers between LPs are
nearly impossible due to paperwork complexity.

### Traditional approach

## How ATK solves it

### Fund unit creation

Apex tokenizes their fund structure as equity tokens representing limited
partner units. Each token carries ownership rights, profit sharing, and
governance participation. The fund's operating agreement is cryptographically
linked to the token metadata.

### LP onboarding

Institutional investors complete accredited investor verification and qualified
purchaser checks through the platform's identity system. Their verified status
enables participation across multiple Apex funds without re-verification.

### Subscription processing and capital tracking

When LPs commit capital, Apex issues fund tokens representing their percentage
ownership. The platform tracks committed versus called capital through on-chain
records.

Note: The ATK fund implementation supports proportional (pro-rata) distributions
based on token holdings. Complex waterfall logic (preferred returns, catch-up
provisions, carried interest tiers) requires custom addon development or
off-chain calculation with on-chain distribution execution.

### NAV updates and performance tracking

Monthly or quarterly, Apex updates the net asset value through the admin portal.
The NAV per token updates automatically for all holders. Performance
metrics—IRR, MOIC, quartile rankings—can be calculated from on-chain transaction
history via subgraph queries or dapp dashboards.

### Automated distributions

When portfolio companies exit or pay dividends, Apex distributes proceeds
proportionally to all token holders through automated workflows. What used to
require wire instructions to 80 different banks now executes through
programmable distribution with instant settlement (via tokenized cash) or
configured payment adapters (for fiat settlement).

### Management fee collection

The platform calculates management fees based on committed capital or NAV
according to fund terms, deducts the appropriate amount, and handles the
transfer to Apex's treasury. Fee schedules are configured in the fund token's
parameters.

### Secondary trading among LPs

When an LP wants to exit early, the platform facilitates transfer to another
qualified institutional investor. Compliance checks ensure the buyer meets
requirements. Settlement happens atomically. Transfer restrictions in the fund
documents are enforced programmatically, so limited transfer windows or ROFR
rights execute automatically via compliance modules.

## Key capabilities

| Capability                  | Traditional                         | With ATK                            |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Fund administration**     | Quarterly fees to third-party admin | On-chain tracking reduces overhead  |
| **NAV distribution**        | 2-3 weeks delay                     | Real-time update to all LPs         |
| **Distribution processing** | Wire to 80 banks, days of work      | Automated proportional distribution |
| **Fee collection**          | Manual invoicing & payment          | Programmatic deduction and transfer |
| **Secondary transfers**     | 90 days + legal costs               | Hours with embedded compliance      |
| **LP reporting**            | Quarterly statements                | Real-time dashboard access          |

## Measurable outcomes

**Operational efficiency** – Fund administration costs drop by approximately 60%
because NAV calculations, distributions, fee collection, and LP reporting are
automated or significantly streamlined.

**LP satisfaction** – Real-time holdings visibility and instant distributions
improve investor experience. Support inquiries about "where's my distribution?"
are eliminated.

**Secondary liquidity** – What used to take 90 days and significant legal costs
now settles in hours with compliance built in. LPs value liquidity options, even
if used rarely.

## Compliance considerations

Private equity fund tokens operate under securities regulations requiring:

- **Qualified purchaser verification** – Enforced via OnchainID claims
- **Holding periods and lock-ups** – Configured via time-lock compliance modules
- **Transfer restrictions** – ROFR rights, limited transfer windows, GP approval
  workflows
- **Jurisdiction controls** – Investment restrictions by geography
- **Audit trails** – Full transaction history for regulatory reporting

For detailed compliance architecture, see
[Compliance & Security](/docs/executive-overview/compliance-security).

## Implementation checklist

1. Define fund structure (equity tokens, percentage ownership model)
2. Select compliance template (qualified purchaser, accredited investor, or
   custom)
3. Integrate KYC/AML provider for institutional LP verification
4. Configure NAV update workflow and admin portal access
5. Set up distribution schedule and payment adapters
6. Configure management fee calculation parameters
7. Upload fund documents (LPA, operating agreement) and link to token metadata
8. Deploy smart contract and conduct initial capital call
9. Test distribution workflow and secondary transfer restrictions

## Limitations and considerations

- **Waterfall complexity** – Out-of-the-box implementation supports pro-rata
  distributions; custom waterfall logic (preferred returns, catch-up, carried
  interest tiers) requires addon development
- **NAV data source** – NAV updates are manual entries via admin portal;
  integration with portfolio valuation systems requires custom API development
- **Regulatory approval** – GP and LP legal counsel should review tokenized
  structure for compatibility with existing fund documents and regulatory
  frameworks
