## The scenario

Apex Capital runs a $200 million venture fund with 80 institutional LPs.
Traditional fund administration is expensive, slow, and opaque. Quarterly
valuations take weeks to calculate and distribute. Capital calls and
distributions require manual processing. Secondary transfers between LPs are
nearly impossible due to paperwork complexity.

## How ATK handles it

**Fund unit creation**: Apex tokenizes their fund structure as equity tokens
representing limited partner units. Each token carries ownership rights, profit
sharing, and governance participation. The fund's operating agreement is
cryptographically linked to the token metadata.

**LP onboarding**: Institutional investors complete accredited investor
verification and qualified purchaser checks through the platform's identity
system. Their verified status enables participation across multiple Apex funds
without re-verification.

**Subscription processing**: When LPs commit capital, Apex issues fund tokens
representing their percentage ownership. The platform tracks committed versus
called capital, maintaining complex waterfall calculations that traditional fund
administrators charge quarterly fees to manage.

**NAV updates and performance tracking**: Monthly or quarterly, Apex updates the
net asset value in the platform. The NAV per token updates automatically for all
holders. Performance metrics—IRR, MOIC, quartile rankings—calculate
programmatically from on-chain transaction history.

**Automated distributions**: When portfolio companies exit or pay dividends,
Apex distributes proceeds proportionally to all token holders through automated
workflows. What used to require wire instructions to 80 different banks now
executes through programmable distribution with instant settlement.

**Management fee collection**: The platform automatically calculates management
fees based on committed capital or NAV according to the fund terms, deducts the
appropriate amount, and handles the transfer to Apex's treasury. No manual
invoicing or collection processes.

**Secondary trading among LPs**: When an LP wants to exit early, the platform
facilitates transfer to another qualified institutional investor. Compliance
checks ensure the buyer meets requirements. Settlement happens atomically.
Transfer restrictions in the fund documents are enforced programmatically, so
limited transfer windows or ROFR rights execute automatically.

**Operational efficiency**: Fund administration costs dropped by 60% because NAV
calculations, distributions, fee collection, and LP reporting are automated.

**LP satisfaction**: Real-time holdings visibility and instant distributions
improved investor experience. Support inquiries about "where's my distribution?"
disappeared.

**Secondary liquidity**: What used to take 90 days and significant legal costs
now settles in hours with compliance built in. LPs value liquidity options, even
if used rarely.
