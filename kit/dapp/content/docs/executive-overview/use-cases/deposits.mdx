## The scenario

Metropolitan Bank wants to offer time deposits (certificates of deposit) as
digital tokens to tech-savvy retail customers while maintaining FDIC insurance
and regulatory compliance.

## How ATK handles it

**Deposit product configuration**: Metropolitan creates deposit tokens with
specific terms: 6-month maturity, 4% APY, minimum $1,000 deposit, maximum
$250,000 per customer to stay within FDIC coverage limits.

**Retail customer onboarding**: Customers complete standard KYC verification
through Metropolitan's existing processes. Their verification status links to
their OnchainID, enabling them to receive deposit tokens.

**Deposit and token issuance**: When a customer deposits $10,000 into a
designated account, Metropolitan verifies the funds cleared and then mints
10,000 deposit tokens to the customer's wallet. The tokens represent their claim
on the principal plus accrued interest.

**Time-lock enforcement**: The smart contract enforces the 6-month maturity.
Customers cannot redeem early (or, if early redemption is allowed, the smart
contract applies penalty calculations automatically).

**Interest accrual tracking**: The platform tracks interest accrued daily based
on the APY. Customers see current value including accumulated interest in real
time.

**Maturity and redemption**: At six months, the tokens become redeemable.
Customers initiate redemption through the portal. The platform burns tokens and
transfers principal plus interest to their designated bank account.

**FDIC compliance**: The platform enforces per-customer deposit limits and
maintains records required for FDIC coverage. All documentation is automatically
generated and archived.

**Collateral management**: Metropolitan maintains liquid reserves or collateral
backing the deposit tokens. The platform tracks reserve ratios and alerts
operations if reserves fall below policy thresholds.

**Customer engagement**: Tech-forward customers appreciated blockchain-based
deposits as innovative while maintaining FDIC insurance and familiar banking
relationships.

**Operational efficiency**: Deposit lifecycle management automated completely.
No manual maturity tracking or redemption processing.

**Transparency**: Customers saw exact interest accrued daily rather than waiting
for statement dates.

**Compliance confidence**: Regulatory filings and FDIC reporting requirements
were satisfied through automated audit trails and data exports.
