## Overview

Digital deposit certificates through ATK modernize time deposit products while
maintaining FDIC insurance and regulatory compliance. The platform handles
maturity enforcement, interest accrual tracking, and automated redemption.

**Who should read this:** Retail banking product managers, compliance officers,
and deposit operations teams exploring digital banking innovation.

**Business value:** Attract tech-forward customers, automate maturity tracking,
eliminate manual interest calculations, and maintain full FDIC compliance.

## Business challenge

Metropolitan Bank wants to offer time deposits (certificates of deposit) as
digital tokens to tech-savvy retail customers while maintaining FDIC insurance
and regulatory compliance.

## How ATK solves it

### Deposit product configuration

Metropolitan creates deposit tokens with specific terms: 6-month maturity, 4%
APY, minimum $1,000 deposit, maximum $250,000 per customer to stay within FDIC
coverage limits.

### Retail customer onboarding

Customers complete standard KYC verification through Metropolitan's existing
processes. Their verification status links to their OnchainID, enabling them to
receive deposit tokens.

### Deposit and token issuance

When a customer deposits $10,000 into a designated account, Metropolitan
verifies the funds cleared and then mints 10,000 deposit tokens to the
customer's wallet. The tokens represent their claim on the principal plus
accrued interest.

### Time-lock enforcement

The smart contract enforces the 6-month maturity via time-lock compliance
modules. Customers cannot redeem early unless early redemption with penalties is
configured.

Note: Early withdrawal penalty calculations require a configured penalty module
or addon. The base time-lock implementation prevents transfer/redemption until
maturity; penalty logic for partial redemptions is an optional configuration.

### Interest accrual tracking

The platform tracks interest accrued based on the APY. Customers see current
value including accumulated interest through the dashboard. Daily accrual
calculation can be implemented via off-chain indexing (subgraph) or periodic
on-chain updates depending on product requirements.

### Maturity and redemption

At six months, the tokens become redeemable. Customers initiate redemption
through the portal. The platform burns tokens and triggers transfer of principal
plus interest to their designated bank account (via core banking integration).

### FDIC compliance

The platform enforces per-customer deposit limits via compliance modules and
maintains records required for FDIC coverage. All documentation is automatically
generated and archived.

### Collateral management

Metropolitan maintains liquid reserves backing the deposit tokens. The platform
tracks reserve ratios through admin dashboard monitoring and can trigger alerts
if reserves fall below policy thresholds.

## Key capabilities

| Capability                | Traditional                | With ATK                             |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Certificate format**    | Paper or PDF               | Digital token in wallet              |
| **Maturity tracking**     | Manual calendar systems    | Smart contract time-lock             |
| **Interest visibility**   | Quarterly statements       | Real-time dashboard                  |
| **Early withdrawal**      | Manual penalty calculation | Configured penalty module (optional) |
| **Redemption processing** | Manual notification & wire | Automated burn and transfer          |
| **FDIC compliance**       | Manual record-keeping      | Automated per-customer limits        |

## Measurable outcomes

**Customer engagement** – Tech-forward customers appreciate blockchain-based
deposits as innovative while maintaining FDIC insurance and familiar banking
relationships.

**Operational efficiency** – Deposit lifecycle management is automated. No
manual maturity tracking or redemption processing.

**Transparency** – Customers see interest accrual in real time rather than
waiting for statement dates.

**Compliance confidence** – Regulatory filings and FDIC reporting requirements
are satisfied through automated audit trails and data exports.

## Compliance considerations

Digital deposit certificates operate under banking regulations:

- **FDIC insurance** – Per-customer limits enforced via compliance modules
- **Customer verification** – KYC requirements via OnchainID claims
- **Interest rate disclosure** – Embedded in token metadata
- **Early withdrawal penalties** – Configured via optional penalty module
- **Record retention** – All transactions recorded on-chain for audit

For detailed compliance architecture, see
[Compliance & Security](/docs/executive-overview/compliance-security).

## Implementation checklist

1. Define deposit product terms (maturity, APY, minimum/maximum amounts)
2. Configure FDIC limit enforcement via compliance modules
3. Integrate KYC provider for customer verification
4. Set up interest accrual tracking (on-chain or indexed via subgraph)
5. Configure time-lock compliance module for maturity enforcement
6. (Optional) Configure penalty module for early withdrawal calculations
7. Integrate core banking system for deposit verification and redemption
8. Deploy smart contract and conduct pilot with select customers
9. Set up customer dashboard for real-time balance visibility

## Limitations and considerations

- **Early withdrawal penalties** – Penalty calculation requires configured
  penalty module; base time-lock implementation prevents redemption until
  maturity
- **Interest accrual** – Daily accrual visibility requires indexing
  infrastructure (subgraph) or periodic on-chain updates
- **FDIC limits** – Per-customer aggregate limits across multiple deposit
  products require coordination with core banking systems
