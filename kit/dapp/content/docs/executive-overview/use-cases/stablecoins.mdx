## Overview

Bank-issued stablecoins through ATK provide instant settlement infrastructure
for B2B payments while maintaining reserve transparency and regulatory
compliance. The platform handles minting, redemption, transaction monitoring,
and reserve management.

**Who should read this:** Treasury teams, payment operations, and financial
institutions exploring blockchain-based payment rails.

**Business value:** Enable instant cross-border settlement, eliminate wire fees,
provide real-time reserve transparency, and maintain AML/sanctions compliance.

## Business challenge

Regional Bank wants to issue a USD-backed stablecoin for commercial clients to
use in B2B payments, trade finance, and treasury management. They need
regulatory compliance, transparent reserves, and enterprise-grade controls.

### Traditional approach

## How ATK solves it

### Stablecoin deployment with reserve management

Regional Bank creates a stablecoin token pegged 1:1 to USD. Each token is backed
by an actual dollar in a segregated reserve account. The platform tracks reserve
balances and enforces that tokens cannot be minted without corresponding fiat
deposits.

### Enterprise client onboarding

Commercial clients complete corporate KYC/KYB verification. Their legal entities
are registered with the platform, and authorized employees receive access to the
treasury portal.

### Minting process

When a client deposits $1 million into the reserve account, Regional Bank's
operations team verifies the deposit through their core banking system. Once
confirmed, the platform mints 1 million stablecoins to the client's designated
wallet. The reserve ratio stays balanced by construction.

### B2B payments and settlements

Clients use stablecoins for vendor payments, international transfers, and supply
chain finance. Transactions settle instantly on-chain with atomic finality.
Payment instructions include invoice references, purchase order numbers, and
other business metadata.

### Transparency and auditability

The platform provides real-time visibility into total stablecoins issued,
reserve balances, and reserve ratio through the admin dashboard. External
auditors can query on-chain data for reserve verification.

Note: Read-only dashboard access for external regulators requires configuration
of role-based permissions and potentially custom portal development for
multi-tenant access patterns.

### Redemption workflows

When clients want to convert stablecoins back to fiat, they initiate a
redemption request. The platform burns tokens and triggers a wire transfer from
reserves to the client's bank account (via core banking integration). The
reserve ratio updates automatically.

### Compliance controls

Regional Bank enforces transaction monitoring, AML screening, and sanctions list
checks through integrated compliance modules. Suspicious activity triggers
alerts for investigation. Geographic restrictions prevent use in prohibited
jurisdictions via country block lists.

### Integration with existing systems

The platform's APIs integrate with Regional Bank's core banking system, treasury
management platform, and accounting systems. Stablecoin transactions can appear
alongside traditional banking transactions through custom portal development or
API consumption by existing client interfaces.

## Key capabilities

| Capability               | Traditional (SWIFT)           | With ATK                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Settlement time**      | 3-5 days                      | Seconds with finality          |
| **Transaction fees**     | $25-50 per wire               | Network gas fees (cents)       |
| **Reconciliation**       | Days of manual work           | Real-time on-chain             |
| **Reserve transparency** | Opaque, periodic attestations | Real-time dashboard visibility |
| **Counterparty risk**    | Settlement lag exposure       | Atomic settlement, zero lag    |
| **Compliance**           | Post-transaction monitoring   | Pre-transaction validation     |

## Measurable outcomes

**Payment speed** – Cross-border B2B payments that took 3-5 days now settle in
seconds with atomic finality.

**Cost reduction** – International wire fees are eliminated. Treasury operations
costs drop because reconciliation is real-time and automated.

**Transparency** – Clients see reserve backing in real time through dashboards,
building confidence in the stablecoin's stability.

**Regulatory acceptance** – Demonstrable compliance controls and transparent
reserves help satisfy regulators during approval processes.

## Compliance considerations

Bank-issued stablecoins operate under banking and payment regulations:

- **AML/KYC verification** – Corporate entity verification via OnchainID
- **Transaction monitoring** – Real-time screening against sanctions lists
- **Geographic restrictions** – Country block lists via compliance modules
- **Reserve requirements** – 1:1 backing enforced at mint/burn operations
- **Audit trails** – Every mint, burn, transfer, and compliance check recorded
  on-chain

For detailed compliance architecture, see
[Compliance & Security](/docs/executive-overview/compliance-security).

## Implementation checklist

1. Establish legal framework for stablecoin issuance (regulatory approval,
   reserve custody)
2. Define stablecoin parameters (pegged currency, reserve requirements, minting
   policies)
3. Integrate KYC/KYB provider for commercial client verification
4. Configure reserve tracking and mint/burn workflows
5. Set up transaction monitoring rules (AML, sanctions, geographic restrictions)
6. Integrate core banking system for reserve account verification
7. Configure redemption workflow and fiat settlement processes
8. Deploy smart contract and conduct pilot with select commercial clients
9. Set up admin dashboard for operations team and reserve monitoring

## Limitations and considerations

- **Regulatory approval** – Bank-issued stablecoins require regulatory
  clearance; legal counsel should evaluate jurisdiction-specific requirements
- **Reserve custody** – Off-chain reserve management requires integration with
  core banking systems for automated verification
- **Regulator dashboard access** – Multi-tenant read-only access for external
  regulators may require custom portal development beyond base admin dashboard
