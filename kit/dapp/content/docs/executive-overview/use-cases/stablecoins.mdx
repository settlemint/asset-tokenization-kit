## The scenario

Regional Bank wants to issue a USD-backed stablecoin for commercial clients to
use in B2B payments, trade finance, and treasury management. They need
regulatory compliance, transparent reserves, and enterprise-grade controls.

### Traditional approach

## How ATK handles it

**Stablecoin deployment with reserve management**: Regional Bank creates a
stablecoin token pegged 1:1 to USD. Each token is backed by an actual dollar in
a segregated reserve account. The platform tracks reserve balances and enforces
that tokens cannot be minted without corresponding fiat deposits.

**Enterprise client onboarding**: Commercial clients complete corporate KYC/KYB
verification. Their legal entities are registered with the platform, and
authorized employees receive access to the treasury portal.

**Minting process**: When a client deposits $1 million into the reserve account,
Regional Bank's operations team verifies the deposit through their core banking
system. Once confirmed, the platform mints 1 million stablecoins to the client's
designated wallet. The reserve ratio stays balanced by construction.

**B2B payments and settlements**: Clients use stablecoins for vendor payments,
international transfers, and supply chain finance. Transactions settle instantly
on-chain with atomic finality. Payment instructions include invoice references,
purchase order numbers, and other business metadata.

**Transparency and auditability**: The platform provides real-time visibility
into total stablecoins issued, reserve balances, and reserve ratio. External
auditors can verify reserves without disrupting operations. Regulators get
read-only access to compliance dashboards.

**Redemption workflows**: When clients want to convert stablecoins back to fiat,
they initiate a redemption request. The platform burns tokens and triggers a
wire transfer from reserves to the client's bank account. The reserve ratio
updates automatically.

**Compliance controls**: Even though stablecoins are designed for broad use,
Regional Bank enforces transaction monitoring, AML screening, and sanctions list
checks. Suspicious activity triggers alerts for investigation. Geographic
restrictions prevent use in prohibited jurisdictions.

**Integration with existing systems**: The platform's APIs integrate with
Regional Bank's core banking system, treasury management platform, and
accounting systems. Stablecoin transactions appear alongside traditional banking
transactions in client portals.

**Payment speed**: Cross-border B2B payments that took 3-5 days now settle in
seconds with finality.

**Cost reduction**: International wire fees disappeared. Treasury operations
costs dropped because reconciliation is real-time.

**Transparency**: Clients see reserve backing in real time, building confidence
in the stablecoin's stability.

**Regulatory acceptance**: Demonstrable compliance controls and transparent
reserves satisfied regulators. Regional Bank got approval to scale the program.
