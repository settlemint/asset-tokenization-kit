title: Core component overview
description:
  The Asset Tokenization Kit consists of five interconnected layers that deliver
  a complete digital asset platform with integrated lifecycle management. Each
  layer serves a distinct role while maintaining tight integration through
  shared types, unified configuration, and a consistent control plane. While
  competitors cobble together separate vendors for token creation, custody,
  settlement, and distributions, ATK provides unified infrastructure where DvP
  settlement, vault custody, and yield automation are architected as core
  capabilities, not afterthought integrations.

## Problem

Digital asset platforms typically integrate multiple third-party services—each
with distinct APIs, data models, and authentication mechanisms. This
fragmentation requires manual reconciliation, increases operational complexity,
and creates consistency gaps across the platform lifecycle. Critically,
fragmented architectures make atomic settlement impossible, disconnect custody
from compliance, and force manual processing of yield distributions.

## Solution

ATK's layers share a unified data model, type-safe interfaces, and synchronized
business logic. This architecture reduces integration complexity and maintains
consistency across operations. **More importantly, it enables lifecycle
management capabilities that fragmented architectures can't deliver**: atomic
multi-party settlements through the XvP addon, multi-signature custody through
vault contracts, and scheduled yield calculations through yield schedules.

## Key concepts

- **Layer modularity**: Each layer handles a distinct concern (UI, API,
  blockchain, storage, deployment) with well-defined interfaces
- **Type-safe integration**: Shared TypeScript types flow from contracts through
  backend to frontend, catching integration errors at compile time
- **Unified control plane**: All layers reference shared configuration and state
  rather than maintaining separate copies
- **Policy consistency**: Compliance rules defined once propagate across all
  layers—frontend validation, API enforcement, and smart contract logic

### 1. [Frontend layer](./frontend-layer)

User-facing interfaces built with TanStack Start, React, and responsive design.
Includes the Asset Designer Wizard, Portfolio Management Dashboard, Compliance
Administration, and Admin Control Panel. Server-side rendering delivers
sub-3-second initial page loads while maintaining client-side interactivity.

### 2. [API layer](./api-layer)

Type-safe ORPC procedures and business services orchestrating asset management,
investor operations, compliance actions, and token distribution. Better Auth
provides authentication and RBAC permissions. The service layer coordinates
cross-cutting concerns like identity verification, notifications, and external
integrations.

### 3. [Blockchain layer](./blockchain-layer)

Solidity smart contracts implementing SMART Protocol tokens with ERC-3643
compliance. Includes system contracts (Core, AccessManager, Factories), asset
tokens (Bond, Equity, Fund, StableCoin, Deposit), and addon modules (Vault,
Airdrop, XvP, Yield). TheGraph subgraph indexes events into a GraphQL API for
sub-100ms queries.

### 4. [Data layer](./data-layer)

PostgreSQL stores application state with Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries.
Redis provides in-memory caching that reduces database load by 70%. MinIO
handles S3-compatible object storage with optional IPFS pinning for tamper-proof
document trails. All storage encrypted at rest with AES-256.

### 5. [Deployment layer](./deployment-layer)

Playwright E2E tests validate complete workflows from UI to blockchain with over
90% code coverage. Helm charts deploy to Kubernetes with horizontal pod
autoscaling, read replicas, and CDN integration. Prometheus, Loki, and
OpenTelemetry provide observability.

## Integration example: Bond issuance workflow

ATK's unified architecture delivers consistent state across layers without
reconciliation steps:

1. **Frontend** - Product lead designs bond in Asset Designer Wizard
2. **API** - Validates configuration and stores in PostgreSQL with audit log
3. **Blockchain** - Factory contract deploys bond token with compliance rules
4. **Data** - TheGraph indexes deployment event within 3 seconds
5. **Frontend** - Dashboard updates automatically via TanStack Query
6. **API** - Investor onboards through shared KYC flow creating OnchainID
7. **Blockchain** - Settlement executes atomic DvP locking tokens and cash
8. **Data** - Redis caches investor balances for instant portfolio queries

Every layer references the same control plane, eliminating reconciliation
between issuance, compliance, custody, and settlement.
