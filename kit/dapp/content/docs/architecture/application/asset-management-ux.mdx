The asset management interface provides intuitive workflows for issuing,
operating, and monitoring tokenized financial instruments. Designed for both
financial professionals and compliance officers, the interface abstracts
blockchain complexity while maintaining full control and transparency.

## Core user workflows

### Token creation journey

The asset designer wizard guides users through token deployment in structured
steps:

#### Step 1: Asset type selection

Interface: `src/routes/_private/_onboarded/_sidebar/addon-designer.tsx`

Users select from five asset classes with contextual descriptions:

- **Bond** - Fixed-income securities with maturity dates and yield distributions
- **Equity** - Company shares with voting rights and dividend capabilities
- **Fund** - Investment fund units with NAV tracking and management fees
- **StableCoin** - Fiat-pegged tokens with reserve management
- **Deposit** - Collateralized deposit certificates with time locks

Each option displays key features, typical use cases, and compliance
requirements.

#### Step 2: Basic token configuration

Form validation ensures:

- **Name** - 3-100 characters, human-readable
- **Symbol** - 1-10 uppercase characters, unique within system
- **Supply** - Positive integer, supports decimals (default 18)
- **Optional identifiers** - ISIN (International Securities Identification
  Number), LEI (Legal Entity Identifier)

Real-time validation prevents common mistakes (duplicate symbols, invalid ISIN
format).

#### Step 3: Compliance rule builder

Visual interface for assembling compliance logic:

**Identity requirements:**

- Minimum KYC level (Level 1: basic info, Level 2: document verification, Level
  3: enhanced due diligence)
- Required claim topics (accredited investor, institutional investor)
- Trusted claim issuers (authorized KYC providers)

**Geographic restrictions:**

- Country allow list (investors from these countries only)
- Country block list (explicitly blocked jurisdictions)
- OFAC sanctions screening integration

**Investor caps:**

- Maximum holder count (e.g., 99 investors for Reg D compliance)
- Maximum individual allocation (ownership concentration limits)
- Minimum holding period (time locks for vesting)

Each rule displays regulatory context (e.g., "Required for SEC Regulation D
offerings") and validation warnings.

#### Step 4: Asset-specific extensions

Configuration adapts to selected asset type:

**Bond features:**

- Maturity date and redemption terms
- Yield schedule (fixed coupon, variable rate, zero-coupon)
- Early redemption options (callable, puttable)
- Collateral tracking (secured vs unsecured)

**Equity features:**

- Voting mechanism (on-chain governance integration)
- Dividend policy (scheduled calculation, claimable)
- Share class (common, preferred, non-voting)
- Anti-dilution protection

**Fund features:**

- NAV calculation frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Management fee structure (flat rate, performance-based)
- Subscription/redemption terms (open-ended, closed-end)
- High-water mark tracking

**StableCoin features:**

- Peg currency (USD, EUR, GBP)
- Reserve account integration (bank API connection)
- Mint/burn controls (role-based permissions)
- Attestation frequency (reserve proof publication)

#### Step 5: Review and deployment

Pre-deployment checklist:

- **Configuration summary** - All parameters in human-readable format
- **Gas estimation** - Transaction cost prediction (current network conditions)
- **Compliance audit** - Automated checks for common misconfigurations
- **Contract preview** - Show which factory and extensions will be deployed

Wallet confirmation modal displays:

- Estimated gas fee
- Factory contract address
- Expected token address (deterministic deployment)
- Transaction risks and irreversibility warning

#### Step 6: Transaction monitoring

Post-submission interface shows:

- **Transaction hash** - Link to block explorer
- **Confirmation status** - Block depth (0/12 confirmations)
- **Estimated time** - Based on current network speed
- **Error handling** - If transaction fails, explain why and offer retry

Once confirmed, redirect to token dashboard with congratulations message and
next steps (invite investors, configure cap table).

### Token dashboard

Interface:
`src/routes/_private/_onboarded/_sidebar/token/$factoryAddress/$tokenAddress/`

After deployment, each token has a dedicated management dashboard.

#### Overview tab (index.tsx)

At-a-glance metrics:

### Addon management

Interface: `src/routes/_private/_onboarded/_sidebar/addon/$addonAddress.tsx`

Users deploy optional addon modules (vault, token sale, XvP settlement) after
initial token deployment.

#### Deploying a token sale

**Use case:** Primary issuance via smart contract sale.

**Configuration:**

- Sale price (in stablecoin or native currency)
- Hard cap (maximum raise amount)
- Soft cap (minimum viable raise)
- Start and end dates
- Whitelist (eligible purchasers)
- Vesting schedule (optional token lock-up)

**Sale management:**

- Dashboard shows:
  - Total raised
  - Tokens sold
  - Unique contributors
  - Time remaining
- Manual close (if target reached early)
- Refund mechanism (if soft cap not met)

#### Configuring vault

**Use case:** Custodial holding for institutional clients.

**Setup:**

- Create vault contract
- Set withdrawal permissions (multi-signature)
- Define authorized operators
- Enable withdrawal limits and time delays

**Operations:**

- Deposit tokens to vault (from issuer or investors)
- Request withdrawal (initiates approval flow)
- View vault holdings and history
- Export custody reports

## Design principles

### Progressive disclosure

Interfaces reveal complexity gradually:

**Default view:**

- Essential information only (token name, balance, compliance status)
- Common actions prominently displayed (transfer, mint)

**Advanced controls:**

- Hidden behind "Advanced" accordion or separate tabs
- Raw contract data, detailed events, low-level configuration

**Expert mode:**

- Developer tools (contract ABI, ethers.js snippets)
- Direct contract interaction (for power users)

### Contextual help

Every form and action includes:

**Inline tooltips:** Hover over field labels for explanations (e.g., "ISIN:
12-character alphanumeric code identifying securities")

**Documentation links:** "Learn more about compliance modules" → opens relevant
docs section

**Example values:** Placeholder text shows valid format (e.g., "ACME Corp" for
token name)

**Validation feedback:** Real-time error messages with specific guidance
("Symbol must be 2-10 uppercase letters without spaces")

### Error prevention

System prevents common mistakes:

**Confirmation dialogs:** High-risk actions (pause token, revoke admin role)
require explicit confirmation with typed phrase (e.g., type "PAUSE" to confirm).

**Irreversibility warnings:** Clearly state actions that cannot be undone ("Once
deployed, token supply cannot be changed").

**Dry-run mode:** Test compliance scenarios without executing transactions
("Will transfer be allowed?" → Yes/No with reason).

**Undo capabilities:** Where possible, provide undo (e.g., revoke recently
granted permissions within 5 minutes).

### Responsive feedback

Every user action provides immediate feedback:

**Optimistic updates:** UI updates immediately (e.g., balance changes before
blockchain confirmation).

**Progress indicators:**

- Spinner for quick actions (&lt;3s expected)
- Progress bar for multi-step workflows
- Block confirmation counter (1/12 confirmations)

**Success confirmation:**

- Toast notification with success icon
- Confetti animation for major milestones (token deployed)
- Redirect to next logical screen

**Error handling:**

- Clear error messages (avoid technical jargon)
- Actionable suggestions ("Transaction failed: Insufficient funds. Please top up
  your wallet.")
- Retry button (for transient failures)

### Accessibility compliance

All interfaces meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards:

**Keyboard navigation:**

- Tab order follows logical flow
- Escape key closes modals
- Arrow keys navigate lists and tables
- Enter/Space activates buttons

**Screen reader support:**

- Semantic HTML (nav, main, article)
- ARIA labels on icons and controls
- Descriptive link text (no "click here")
- Form field labels properly associated

**Visual accessibility:**

- 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text
- Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements
- No color-only information encoding
- Font size adjustable without breaking layout

## Integration with backend

Asset management UI calls backend via ORPC:

**Token creation:**

```typescript
const createToken = orpc.token.create.useMutation();
await createToken.mutateAsync({
  type: "equity",
  name: formData.name,
  symbol: formData.symbol,
  initialSupply: BigInt(formData.supply),
});
```

**Fetching token data:**

```typescript
const { data: token } = orpc.token.read.useQuery({
  address: tokenAddress,
});
```

**Distribution execution:**

```typescript
const distribute = orpc.token.yield.distribute.useMutation();
await distribute.mutateAsync({
  tokenAddress,
  amount: distributionAmount,
  recordDate: new Date(),
});
```

All mutations trigger TanStack Query cache invalidation, automatically
refreshing dependent UI components. Optimistic updates provide instant feedback
before blockchain confirmation.

See [Backend API architecture](./backend-api) for complete procedure reference.
