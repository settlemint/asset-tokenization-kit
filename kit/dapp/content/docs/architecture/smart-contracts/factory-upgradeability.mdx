## Factory contract architecture

Factory contracts establish standardized deployment infrastructure for tokenized
assets. Rather than deploying token contracts manually with varying
initialization patterns, factories ensure every token instance follows identical
deployment procedures, inherits verified implementations, and integrates
correctly with the broader system.

The factory pattern separates deployment logic from business logic. Token
contracts define what a bond or equity does; factory contracts define how those
tokens are created, initialized, and registered within the ATK ecosystem.

### Deployment consistency guarantees

Manual contract deployment introduces variation. Different operators might use
different constructor parameters, skip initialization steps, or misconfigure
access control. Factory deployment eliminates this variability through enforced
deployment scripts.

When a factory deploys a token, it executes a deterministic sequence: deploy the
proxy contract at a CREATE2 address, link it to the verified implementation,
initialize the token with validated parameters, register the token's OnchainID
identity, assign required system roles, and emit standardized events for
indexing. This sequence executes atomically—either all steps succeed, or the
deployment reverts.

The
[AbstractATKTokenFactoryImplementation](https://github.com/settlemint/asset-tokenization-kit/blob/main/kit/contracts/contracts/system/tokens/factory/AbstractATKTokenFactoryImplementation.sol)
contract defines this common deployment sequence for all asset types.
Asset-specific factories (bonds, equities, funds) extend this base
implementation with type-specific initialization logic while inheriting the core
deployment guarantees.

### Deployment discovery and tracking

Factories maintain deployment registries. Each deployed token is recorded in the
factory's state with its address, type identifier, and deployment timestamp. The
ATK System queries these registries to enumerate all tokens of a given type,
verify deployment authenticity, and track system growth.

The
[IATKTokenFactory](https://github.com/settlemint/asset-tokenization-kit/blob/main/kit/contracts/contracts/system/tokens/factory/IATKTokenFactory.sol)
interface defines the deployment tracking methods. Factories emit
`TokenDeployed` events containing the token address, implementation version, and
deployer identity. The subgraph indexes these events, making deployment history
queryable through GraphQL.

Observability dashboards track factory usage metrics: deployment frequency, gas
costs per deployment, implementation version distribution, and factory
utilization rates. These metrics inform capacity planning and identify
deployment bottlenecks as the platform scales.

## Token factory registry

The Token Factory Registry serves as the central directory for all factory
contracts in the ATK system. Rather than hardcoding factory addresses throughout
the platform, contracts query the registry to discover the appropriate factory
for each asset type.

### Registry-based factory discovery

The
[ATKTokenFactoryRegistry](https://github.com/settlemint/asset-tokenization-kit/blob/main/kit/contracts/contracts/system/tokens/factory/registry/ATKTokenFactoryRegistryImplementation.sol)
maps asset type identifiers to factory addresses. When the frontend needs to
deploy a bond, it queries the registry for the "BOND" type and receives the
current bond factory address. This indirection enables factory upgrades without
modifying client code.

Type identifiers use consistent string constants: `BOND`, `EQUITY`, `FUND`,
`DEPOSIT`, `STABLECOIN`. The registry validates type identifiers during
registration to prevent typos or duplicate registrations.

`}
/>

### Registry access control

Only addresses with `SYSTEM_MANAGER_ROLE` can register or update factory
addresses in the registry. This prevents unauthorized parties from redirecting
deployment requests to malicious factory contracts.

Factory registration requires both the factory address and its implementation
address. The registry verifies that the factory contract exists at the provided
address before recording the registration. This validation prevents registration
of invalid or non-existent contracts.

### Factory versioning and updates

The registry supports factory replacement. When a factory implementation is
upgraded, the `SYSTEM_MANAGER_ROLE` registers the new factory address for the
same type identifier. Existing tokens deployed by the old factory remain
unchanged; new deployments use the updated factory.

The registry emits `FactoryRegistered` and `FactoryUpdated` events when
factories are added or replaced. These events include the type identifier, old
factory address (if applicable), and new factory address. The subgraph tracks
factory version history, enabling auditors to determine which factory deployed
each token.

## Upgradeable proxy architecture

The ATK system uses the Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard (UUPS) pattern to
enable contract logic upgrades while preserving deployed addresses and contract
state. This architecture separates storage (maintained in the proxy) from logic
(implemented in upgradeable contracts).

### Proxy delegation mechanism

The
[ATKTypedImplementationProxy](https://github.com/settlemint/asset-tokenization-kit/blob/main/kit/contracts/contracts/system/ATKTypedImplementationProxy.sol)
contract implements the proxy pattern. When a user calls a function on a proxy
address, the proxy uses `delegatecall` to execute the function in the
implementation contract's code while operating on the proxy's storage.

This delegation preserves the proxy's address and state across upgrades. Users
interact with the same contract address before and after an upgrade. The upgrade
changes which implementation contract receives delegated calls, but the proxy
address and stored data remain constant.

    style Storage fill:#6ba4d4,stroke:#4a7ba8,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
`}
/>

### Storage layout compatibility

Upgrades must maintain storage layout compatibility. Since the proxy stores all
state variables, the new implementation must interpret those storage slots
identically to the old implementation. Adding new variables is safe (they occupy
new slots); reordering existing variables corrupts state.

Solidity's storage layout rules assign slots sequentially based on variable
declaration order. Implementation contracts use inheritance to preserve this
order across upgrades. New versions extend the base contract and add new
variables at the end, ensuring existing slots retain their meaning.

The ATK system uses OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contract library, which provides
storage-safe base contracts and initialization patterns. These contracts prevent
constructor usage (constructors don't affect proxy storage) and require explicit
`initialize` functions called once after deployment.

### Initialization protection

Initialization functions must execute exactly once per proxy deployment.
Multiple initializations could reset state, reassign roles, or create
inconsistencies. The `Initializable` base contract enforces single
initialization through a storage flag.

When a proxy is deployed, the factory calls the implementation's `initialize`
function through the proxy. The `Initializable` modifier checks the
initialization flag, executes the initialization logic if uninitialized, sets
the flag, and reverts if already initialized.

Upgrades may introduce new initialization logic for added features. These
functions use versioned modifiers (`initializerV2`, `initializerV3`) that track
which initialization versions have executed, allowing partial re-initialization
while preventing duplicate execution of earlier initialization code.

## Upgrade authorization and governance

The ATK system centralizes upgrade authority in the ATK System contract.
Individual token proxies do not control their own upgrades; instead, the ATK
System manages implementation addresses for all proxies it deploys.

### Centralized upgrade management

The
[ATKSystemImplementation](https://github.com/settlemint/asset-tokenization-kit/blob/main/kit/contracts/contracts/system/ATKSystemImplementation.sol)
contract stores implementation addresses for every system component: identity
registries, compliance modules, token implementations, and addon contracts. When
the system needs to upgrade a component, it updates the corresponding
implementation address in its registry.

This centralization provides consistent upgrade procedures across all
components. Rather than each token proxy implementing its own upgrade
authorization, proxies delegate upgrade decisions to the ATK System. The system
verifies that only authorized roles (typically `SYSTEM_MANAGER_ROLE`) can
trigger upgrades.

### Upgrade execution flow

Upgrades follow a structured sequence to minimize risk and ensure atomicity. The
process begins with implementation deployment, followed by upgrade proposal,
authorization verification, proxy update, and post-upgrade validation.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the complete upgrade flow from the
factory owner's initiation through the proxy's implementation pointer update:

    UpgradeContract->>UpgradeContract: validate new implementation
    UpgradeContract->>UpgradeContract: verify authorization
    UpgradeContract->>Proxy: upgradeToAndCall(newImpl)
    
    Proxy->>OldImpl: delegatecall _authorizeUpgrade
    OldImpl->>UpgradeContract: check permissions
    UpgradeContract-->>OldImpl: authorized
    OldImpl-->>Proxy: upgrade authorized

    Note over NewImpl: New implementation receives<br/>all future calls
    
    Proxy-->>UpgradeContract: upgrade complete
    UpgradeContract-->>FactoryOwner: success
`}
/>

This upgrade pattern ensures existing state remains intact while seamlessly
transitioning to new logic. The old implementation contract remains deployed and
accessible for historical reference, but the proxy redirects all future calls to
the new implementation.

`}
/>

The upgrade proposal phase allows separation between deployment and execution.
The system manager deploys the new implementation, registers it with the system,
and validates its correctness. The actual upgrade execution occurs separately,
after testing and review.

### Multi-signature governance

Production deployments should protect upgrade authority with multi-signature
wallets. Rather than assigning `SYSTEM_MANAGER_ROLE` to a single externally
owned account, the role is granted to a multi-sig contract requiring multiple
authorized signers to approve upgrades.

This governance structure prevents single points of compromise. An attacker who
gains control of one signer's private key cannot unilaterally upgrade contracts.
The multi-sig threshold (e.g., 3-of-5 signers) balances security with
operational flexibility.

Time-locked upgrades provide additional security. The system manager proposes an
upgrade, which enters a time-lock period (e.g., 48 hours) before execution.
During this period, other signers review the proposal, the community is
notified, and emergency procedures can halt the upgrade if issues are
discovered.

### Upgrade observability and auditing

Every upgrade emits detailed events captured by the observability stack. The
`ImplementationUpgraded` event records the proxy address, old implementation
address, new implementation address, upgrade timestamp, and executing manager
address.

The [subgraph](/docs/architecture/data-indexing/blockchain-indexing) indexes
these events, building a complete upgrade history for every contract in the
system. Auditors query this history to verify upgrade frequency, review upgrade
authorization, and ensure upgrade procedures followed governance rules.

Observability dashboards display implementation version distributions across
deployed contracts. These metrics identify contracts running outdated
implementations, track upgrade adoption rates, and highlight potential security
vulnerabilities in older versions requiring urgent upgrades.

## Upgrade vs. immutability: pattern selection

Not all contracts should be upgradeable. Upgradeability introduces complexity,
governance requirements, and potential security risks. The decision between
upgradeable and immutable deployments depends on the contract's role, expected
evolution, and risk tolerance.

### When to use upgradeable contracts

Upgradeable contracts suit system infrastructure where requirements evolve over
time. Core system components like the identity registry, compliance engine, and
token factories benefit from upgradeability because regulatory requirements
change, new features emerge, and bugs may require fixes.

Consider a scenario where a new regulatory requirement mandates additional
investor disclosures. If token contracts are upgradeable, the system manager
deploys an updated implementation with the new disclosure logic, upgrades all
tokens, and achieves compliance without migrating state or changing token
addresses.

System-level infrastructure should prioritize upgradeability. The ATK System,
factory contracts, and registries use UUPS proxies because these components
orchestrate the entire platform. Bugs in these contracts affect all deployed
tokens; upgradeability provides a path to fix critical issues without
redeploying the entire system.

### When to use immutable contracts

Immutable contracts suit final, well-understood logic where changes would
undermine trust. Individual compliance modules, mathematical libraries, and
cryptographic functions often work better as immutable contracts because their
correctness is provable and any modification raises security concerns.

Consider an immutable compliance module that checks whether an investor's
country is permitted. This logic is simple, well-tested, and regulatory
authorities may have reviewed and approved the exact bytecode deployed on-chain.
Making it upgradeable introduces risk: an upgrade could silently weaken
compliance rules without external visibility.

Individual token deployments may prefer immutability after a stabilization
period. During initial issuance, upgradeability allows fixing bugs and adding
features. Once the token has been live for months, operated correctly, and
passed audits, the issuer might intentionally revoke upgrade privileges, making
the contract permanently immutable. This commitment strengthens investor
confidence by removing the risk of malicious upgrades.

### Hybrid approach: factory-managed immutability

The ATK factory pattern enables a hybrid approach. Factories are upgradeable,
but the tokens they deploy can be immutable. When requirements change, the
factory is upgraded to deploy tokens with new logic. Existing tokens remain
unchanged; new tokens incorporate the improvements.

This strategy suits scenarios where backward compatibility isn't required. New
bond issuances use the latest compliance rules and yield calculation logic,
while older bonds continue operating under their original rules. Investors in
legacy bonds have certainty about unchanging behavior; new investors benefit
from improved implementations.

## Real-world upgrade scenarios

Understanding upgrade patterns requires examining specific scenarios where
implementations must change. These scenarios illustrate when upgrades are
necessary, how they are executed, and what risks they mitigate.

### Scenario: regulatory compliance update

A jurisdiction introduces a new regulation requiring token transfers to include
a reference identifier linking to a disclosure document. Existing token
contracts do not support this field; adding it requires an implementation
upgrade.

The system manager deploys a new token implementation extending the `transfer`
function to accept an optional reference parameter. The implementation maintains
backward compatibility by making the reference optional and defaulting to an
empty value if not provided.

The upgrade proposal is submitted to the multi-signature governance wallet.
During the review period, the new implementation is deployed to testnet, tested
with representative transactions, and audited for storage layout compatibility.
After 48 hours, the multi-sig signers approve the upgrade.

The system manager executes the upgrade across all tokens deployed through the
factory. The subgraph indexes the upgrade events, and the observability
dashboard confirms all tokens now run the updated implementation. Transfer
transactions include the new reference field, and the system achieves regulatory
compliance without disrupting existing token holders.

### Scenario: security vulnerability patch

A security researcher discovers a reentrancy vulnerability in the yield
distribution logic. The vulnerability allows an attacker to recursively call the
distribution function, potentially draining contract funds.

The vulnerability is disclosed privately to the development team. An emergency
patch is prepared, fixing the reentrancy vector by adding a reentrancy guard to
affected functions. The patch is reviewed, tested against exploit scenarios, and
verified to prevent the attack.

Because the contracts are upgradeable, the patch can be deployed immediately. If
the contracts were immutable, the only remediation would be migrating all state
to new contract addresses—a complex, expensive, and risky operation. The upgrade
executes within hours of vulnerability disclosure, securing user funds without
requiring manual migration.

### Scenario: feature enhancement

A new feature enables automatic yield reinvestment. Token holders can opt into a
program where distributed yields are automatically used to purchase additional
tokens rather than being paid out as currency.

This feature requires new state variables to track opt-in status and new
functions to process reinvestment transactions. The implementation is deployed,
tested, and proposed for upgrade. Because the feature is additive, it does not
affect existing functionality; token holders who do not opt in experience no
behavior change.

The upgrade demonstrates the value of upgradeability for non-critical
enhancements. The feature can be deployed to existing tokens without requiring
users to migrate to new contracts. Adoption is gradual; as users opt in, they
benefit from the new functionality while maintaining their existing token
balances and addresses.

### Scenario: gas optimization

After several months in production, gas profiling reveals that certain
compliance check functions consume excessive gas. An optimized implementation
reduces gas usage by 30% through algorithmic improvements and storage pattern
changes.

The optimization maintains identical external behavior but changes internal
implementation details. Because the contracts are upgradeable, this optimization
can be deployed to all tokens, immediately reducing transaction costs for all
users without requiring code changes in client applications or modifications to
user workflows.

## Upgrade safety mechanisms

Upgrades introduce risk. Incorrect implementations can corrupt state, break
functionality, or introduce vulnerabilities. The ATK system includes multiple
safety mechanisms to mitigate upgrade risks and ensure upgrade procedures follow
best practices.

### Storage gap patterns

Upgradeable contracts reserve storage slots for future variables using the
storage gap pattern. Rather than tightly packing storage variables,
implementations include a `__gap` array sized to leave room for future
additions.

```solidity
contract TokenImplementationV1 {
    address public admin;
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    // Reserve 50 slots for future variables
    uint256[47] private __gap;
}
```

When V2 adds a new variable, it reduces the gap size by the number of new slots:

```solidity
contract TokenImplementationV2 is TokenImplementationV1 {
    uint256 public feeBasisPoints; // New variable

    // Gap reduced to maintain total slot count
    uint256[46] private __gap;
}
```

This pattern ensures new variables occupy slots beyond the original
implementation's variables, preventing storage collisions and maintaining
compatibility.

### Upgrade authorization functions

UUPS proxies require implementation contracts to include an `_authorizeUpgrade`
function. This function is called before upgrade execution and can implement
custom authorization logic.

In the ATK system, `_authorizeUpgrade` verifies that the caller has
`SYSTEM_MANAGER_ROLE` in the ATK System contract. This prevents unauthorized
parties from upgrading contracts even if they somehow gain control of the
proxy's upgrade function.

```solidity
function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override {
    require(
        atkSystem.hasRole(SYSTEM_MANAGER_ROLE, msg.sender),
        "Unauthorized upgrade"
    );
    emit UpgradeAuthorized(newImplementation, msg.sender);
}
```

### Initialization version tracking

Upgrades may require re-initialization to set up new features. The
`Initializable` contract tracks initialization versions through bit flags,
allowing implementations to define which initialization functions have executed.

When V2 adds a feature requiring initialization, it defines an `initializeV2`
function with the `reinitializer(2)` modifier. This modifier ensures V2
initialization executes exactly once, regardless of how many times the contract
is upgraded or downgraded.

```solidity
function initializeV2(uint256 newFeatureParam) public reinitializer(2) {
    _newFeatureParam = newFeatureParam;
    _setupNewFeature();
}
```

### Implementation validation

The ATK System validates implementation contracts before recording them in
registries. Validation checks that the implementation address contains contract
code, implements required interfaces, and matches expected type identifiers.

This validation prevents misconfigurations where the wrong implementation
address is registered for a token type. For example, registering the bond
implementation address as the equity factory implementation would cause equity
deployments to fail. The validation step catches these errors before they affect
production.

## Observability integration

The observability stack tracks contract versions, upgrade events, and
implementation distribution across deployed tokens. This visibility enables
operators to monitor upgrade adoption, identify outdated contracts, and verify
upgrade execution.

### Version tracking metrics

The subgraph indexes every deployment and upgrade event, building a database of
which implementation version each proxy is running. The
[observability dashboard](/docs/developer-guides/deployment-ops/observability-monitoring)
displays implementation version distributions for each token type.

Operators query these metrics to answer questions like: "What percentage of
bonds are running the latest implementation?" or "Which tokens still use the
vulnerable V1.2 implementation?" This information informs upgrade planning and
identifies contracts requiring urgent attention.

### Upgrade event monitoring

Upgrade events flow through the observability pipeline. When an upgrade
executes, the `ImplementationUpgraded` event is emitted, indexed by the
subgraph, stored in PostgreSQL, and displayed on real-time dashboards.

Alerts trigger if upgrades occur outside maintenance windows, if unauthorized
addresses attempt upgrades, or if upgrade execution fails. These alerts enable
rapid response to unexpected upgrade activity or potential security incidents.

### Gas cost analysis

Observability dashboards track gas costs for factory deployments and upgrade
transactions. These metrics inform capacity planning: as gas prices fluctuate,
operators monitor whether deployment costs remain within acceptable ranges.

Gas cost trends also reveal optimization opportunities. If deployment costs
increase over time, profiling identifies which initialization steps consume
excessive gas and guides implementation improvements to reduce costs.

## Production deployment strategy

Production environments require careful planning for factory deployment,
implementation management, and upgrade procedures. The following strategy
minimizes risk while enabling ongoing system evolution.

### Initial system deployment

Begin by deploying the ATK System Factory and creating a new system instance.
The factory deploys the ATK System proxy and initializes it with the founding
admin address. This admin should be a multi-signature wallet, not an individual
externally owned account.

Once the system exists, execute the bootstrap process. Bootstrap deploys core
infrastructure contracts: identity registry, compliance module registry, trusted
issuer registry, claim topics registry, token factory registry, and addon
registry. Bootstrap is a one-time operation per system instance; subsequent
configuration uses registry functions.

After bootstrap, register factory contracts for each asset type. Deploy bond
factory implementation, deploy bond factory proxy, initialize factory with ATK
System address, register factory in token factory registry. Repeat for equity,
fund, deposit, and stablecoin factories.

`}
/>

### Upgrade testing procedures

Never upgrade production implementations without comprehensive testing. Begin by
deploying the new implementation to testnet. Execute representative
transactions: token transfers, compliance checks, yield distributions, and
administrative functions. Compare gas costs, verify state changes, and ensure no
regressions.

Deploy the new implementation to a staging environment that mirrors production
configuration. Perform upgrade dry runs on staging proxies, validate
post-upgrade state, and test rollback procedures. Only after staging validation
should production upgrades be considered.

### Phased upgrade rollout

For large-scale upgrades affecting many tokens, phase the rollout. Begin by
upgrading a small subset of tokens (e.g., internal test tokens or low-value
assets). Monitor these tokens for issues over 24-48 hours. If no problems
emerge, upgrade additional tokens in larger batches.

Phased rollout limits blast radius. If the upgrade introduces a subtle bug, only
early-phase tokens are affected. The remaining tokens stay on the old
implementation until the bug is fixed. This strategy prevents system-wide
failures from untested implementation changes.

### Rollback procedures

Despite careful testing, upgrades may need reverting. The UUPS pattern supports
rollback: the proxy can be re-pointed to the previous implementation address.
Rollback procedures should be documented, tested, and ready to execute on short
notice.

Rollback decisions depend on the nature of the issue. If the upgrade corrupts
state or introduces a critical vulnerability, immediate rollback is appropriate.
If the upgrade merely degrades performance or introduces non-critical bugs, a
scheduled rollback after user notification may be preferable.

## Conclusion

Factory patterns and upgradeable proxies form the foundation of the ATK system's
deployment and evolution infrastructure. Factories ensure consistent, auditable
token deployment with deterministic addressing and standardized initialization.
Upgradeable proxies enable the system to evolve—fixing bugs, adding features,
and adapting to regulatory changes—without disrupting deployed tokens or
requiring state migration.

This architecture balances flexibility with security. Centralized upgrade
management through the ATK System prevents unauthorized modifications while
enabling coordinated upgrades across all system components. Multi-signature
governance and time-locked upgrades provide additional safety, ensuring upgrades
cannot be executed unilaterally.

The choice between upgradeable and immutable contracts depends on context.
System infrastructure benefits from upgradeability for ongoing evolution;
individual tokens may transition to immutability after stabilization to maximize
trust. The factory pattern enables both approaches, allowing new tokens to use
improved implementations while legacy tokens remain unchanged.

Observability integration ensures visibility into deployment patterns,
implementation versions, and upgrade history. Operators monitor upgrade
adoption, track contract versions, and verify upgrade procedures follow
governance rules. This visibility supports audit requirements and informs
operational decisions.

Together, these patterns enable the ATK system to operate as production
infrastructure for regulated financial instruments—secure enough for
institutional adoption, flexible enough to evolve with regulatory requirements,
and observable enough to meet enterprise operational standards.
