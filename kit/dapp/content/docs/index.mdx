## ROI Calculator Framework

### Quick Assessment Formula

```
Annual Savings = (Current Costs × 0.90) - (ATK Costs)
Payback Months = Initial Investment ÷ (Monthly Savings)
3-Year ROI = (Total Savings - Total Investment) ÷ Total Investment × 100%
```

### Example Calculation (Mid-Size Institution)

```
Current Costs: $200K/month = $2.4M/year
ATK Costs: $15K/month = $180K/year
Annual Savings: $2.4M - $180K = $2.22M
Initial Investment: $200K
Payback: $200K ÷ $185K monthly savings = 1.1 months
3-Year ROI: ($6.66M - $740K) ÷ $740K = 800%
```

## Decision Framework

**Three questions determine your ROI timeline:**

1. **What do you spend monthly on securities operations?**
   - If >$50K/month: Payback &lt;6 months
   - If >$100K/month: Payback &lt;3 months
   - If >$250K/month: Payback &lt;45 days

2. **How many vendors do you currently integrate?**
   - If >3 vendors: Save $500K+ annually on integration
   - If >5 vendors: Save $1M+ annually on maintenance
   - If >7 vendors: Save $2M+ annually on reconciliation

3. **What is your settlement risk exposure?**
   - If >$1M daily: Eliminate $365M annual exposure
   - If >$5M daily: Eliminate $1.8B annual exposure
   - If >$10M daily: Eliminate $3.6B annual exposure
