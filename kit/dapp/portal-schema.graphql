  This function allows other contracts/tools to query if this contract implements specific interfaces. It checks for: 1.  `type(IERC3643TrustedIssuersRegistry).interfaceId`: Confirms adherence to the ERC-3643 standard for     trusted issuer registries. 2.  Interfaces supported by parent contracts (e.g., `AccessControlUpgradeable`, `ERC165Upgradeable`)     via `super.supportsInterface(interfaceId)`. Crucial for interoperability, allowing other components to verify compatibility.
  `true` if the contract supports `interfaceId`, `false` otherwise.

For each claim, verify its issuer is trusted for that topic via the `identityRegistry`'s `issuersRegistry`.      3.

The function should return the details of the *first* claim that successfully passes all these validations.      If no such claim is found, it should return zero values.

  Attempts to find the first valid collateral claim associated with the token contract's         own OnchainID identity, based on a pre-configured claim topic.
  This function is expected to perform several checks:      1. Retrieve claim IDs from the token's identity contract (`this.onchainID()`) for the configured `collateralProofTopic`.      2. For each claim, verify its issuer is trusted for that topic via the `identityRegistry`'s `issuersRegistry`.      3. Confirm the trusted issuer contract itself deems the claim valid (e.g., via `IClaimIssuer.isClaimValid`).      4. Decode the claim data, which is expected to contain a collateral `amount` and an `expiryTimestamp`.      5. Ensure the claim has not expired (i.e., `decodedExpiry > block.timestamp`).      The function should return the details of the *first* claim that successfully passes all these validations.      If no such claim is found, it should return zero values.

  Initializes the `SMARTIdentityRegistryStorageImplementation` contract. This function acts as the constructor for an upgradeable contract and can only be called once.
  This function is typically called by the deployer immediately after the proxy contract pointing to this implementation is deployed. It sets up the initial state: 1.  `__ERC165_init_unchained()`: Initializes the ERC165 interface detection mechanism, allowing other contracts     to query what interfaces this contract supports (e.g., `IERC3643IdentityRegistryStorage`). 2.  `__AccessControlEnumerable_init_unchained()`: Initializes the role-based access control system. It sets up     the structures needed to grant, revoke, and check roles. 3.  `_grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, initialAdmin)`: Grants the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to the `initialAdmin`     address. The admin can manage all other roles and aspects of the access control. 4.  `_grantRole(STORAGE_MODIFIER_ROLE, initialAdmin)`: Grants the `STORAGE_MODIFIER_ROLE` to the `initialAdmin`.     This is often a temporary measure for bootstrapping; the `initialAdmin` (or the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`     holder) would typically later grant this role to operational contracts like bound identity registries and     revoke it from themselves if direct modification by the admin is not intended long-term. 5.  `_grantRole(MANAGE_REGISTRIES_ROLE, system)`: Grants the `MANAGE_REGISTRIES_ROLE` to the `system` address.     The `system` address (e.g., a `SMARTSystem` contract or an identity factory contract) is then responsible     for binding and unbinding `SMARTIdentityRegistry` contracts, which in turn modify the storage. The `initializer` modifier from `Initializable` ensures this function can only be executed once, preventing re-initialization.

  Adds a new trusted issuer to the registry with a specified list of claim topics they are authorized for.
  This function can only be called by an address holding the `REGISTRAR_ROLE`.

If all checks pass, the function: 1.  Stores the issuer's details (address, claim topics, and `exists = true`) in the `_trustedIssuers` mapping. 2.

  Initializes the `SMARTTrustedIssuersRegistryImplementation` contract. This function acts as the constructor for an upgradeable contract and can only be called once.
  This function is typically called by the deployer immediately after the proxy contract pointing to this implementation is deployed. It sets up the initial state: 1.  `__ERC165_init_unchained()`: Initializes ERC165 interface detection. 2.  `__AccessControlEnumerable_init_unchained()`: Initializes the role-based access control system. 3.  The `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable` is already initialized by its own constructor. 4.  `_grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, initialAdmin)`: Grants the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to `initialAdmin`.     The admin can manage all other roles, including granting/revoking `REGISTRAR_ROLE`. 5.  `_grantRole(REGISTRAR_ROLE, initialAdmin)`: Grants the `REGISTRAR_ROLE` to `initialAdmin`.     This allows the `initialAdmin` to immediately start adding trusted issuers. This role can later be     transferred or granted to other operational addresses/contracts. The `initializer` modifier from `Initializable` ensures this function can only be executed once.

  Allows the caller (the token holder) to redeem all of their own tokens.
  When a token holder calls this function, their entire balance of this token will be burned (destroyed). This action reduces the token holder's balance to zero and decreases the total supply of the token accordingly. The function should: 1. Determine the caller's current token balance. 2. Optionally execute a `_beforeRedeem` hook for pre-redemption logic with the full balance amount. 3. Perform the burn operation for the full balance via an internal function like `_redeemable_executeBurn`. 4. Optionally execute an `_afterRedeem` hook for post-redemption logic with the full balance amount. 5. Emit a `Redeemed` event to log the transaction on the blockchain. The contract implementing this interface is expected to use `_msgSender()` to identify the caller.
  A boolean value indicating whether the redemption of all tokens was successful (typically `true`).
