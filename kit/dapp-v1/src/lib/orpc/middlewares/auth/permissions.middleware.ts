/**
 * CRUD permission types for API key authorization.
 *
 * Defines the standard CRUD operations that can be required for API key access:
 * - read: View/retrieve data
 * - create: Create data
 * - update: Update data
 * - delete: Remove data
 */

/**
 * Creates a permissions middleware for specific CRUD permissions and user roles.
 *
 * This function returns a middleware that automatically extracts the resource type
 * from the ORPC procedure path and validates that the user has the required role
 * permissions and, if present, that the API key has the required CRUD permissions
 * for that resource.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Automatic resource extraction from path (e.g., "planet" from "planet.find")
 * - User role-based permission checking as baseline security
 * - CRUD-based API key permission checking as additional restrictions
 * - API keys can only restrict access, never expand it beyond user permissions
 * - Clear error messages indicating missing permissions
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * // Require read permission for the resource (extracted from path)
 * export const find = ar.planet.find
 *   .use(permissionsMiddleware({ requiredPermissions: ["read"], roles: ["user"] }))
 *   .handler(async ({ input }) => { ... });
 *
 * // Require write permission for creating/updating
 * export const create = ar.planet.create
 *   .use(permissionsMiddleware({ requiredPermissions: ["create"], roles: ["admin"] }))
 *   .handler(async ({ input }) => { ... });
 *
 * // Require multiple permissions
 * export const adminAction = ar.planet.adminAction
 *   .use(permissionsMiddleware({ requiredPermissions: ["read", "delete"], roles: ["admin"] }))
 *   .handler(async ({ input }) => { ... });
 * ```
 *
 * The middleware will:
 * 1. Extract resource type from the first segment of the procedure path
 * 2. First check user role permissions (if roles are specified)
 * 3. If API key is present, verify it has the required permissions for the resource
 * 4. API key permissions act as additional restrictions on top of user permissions
 * 5. Throw FORBIDDEN if user role or API key lacks required permissions
 *
 * @param requiredPermissions - Array of CRUD permissions required for this endpoint
 * @param roles - Array of user roles required for this endpoint
 * @returns Middleware function that checks user role and API key permissions
 * @throws UNAUTHORIZED - When user is not authenticated
 * @throws FORBIDDEN - When user role or API key lacks required permissions for the resource
