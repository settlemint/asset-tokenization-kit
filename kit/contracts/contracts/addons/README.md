# ATK System Addons

‚ú® [https://settlemint.com](https://settlemint.com) ‚ú®

**A comprehensive suite of system addons that extend the ATK Protocol with
additional functionality for airdrops, vaults, cross-value settlements, and
yield management**

## üìã What are ATK System Addons?

ATK System Addons are modular extensions that provide additional functionality
beyond core asset tokenization. These addons integrate with the ATK System
infrastructure to offer specialized capabilities for token distribution,
treasury management, cross-chain settlements, and yield strategies.

Unlike assets (which are tokenized instruments), addons are operational tools
that work alongside the tokenization infrastructure to provide enhanced
functionality for ecosystem participants.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

ATK System Addons follow a modular architecture with specialized functionality:

### 2. **Vault** (`vault/`)

    Vault->>Vault: Store transaction proposal

    Signer2->>Vault: confirmTransaction(txIndex)
    Vault->>Vault: Check if enough confirmations

    alt Sufficient confirmations
        Vault->>Target: Execute transaction
        Vault->>Signer1: Transaction executed
        Vault->>Signer2: Transaction executed
    else Insufficient confirmations
        Vault->>Signer2: Awaiting more confirmations
    end
```

### 3. **XvP Settlement** (`xvp/`)

Cross-Value Proposition atomic settlement system for multi-party token exchanges

**Overview:** A sophisticated settlement system that enables atomic swaps
between multiple parties with different tokens, ensuring all transfers happen
together or none at all.

**Core Features:**

- Multi-party atomic settlements
- Support for any number of participants
- Configurable expiration dates
- Per-sender approval system for local senders only
- Automatic execution options gated by HTLC coordination
- Optional cross-chain hashlock enforcement

**XvP-Specific Features:**

#### Atomic Settlement Engine

- **Multi-Party Support**: Any number of participants
- **Flow Management**: Multiple token flows in single settlement
- **All-or-Nothing**: Atomic execution guarantees
- **Expiration Handling**: Time-based settlement expiry

#### Approval System

- **Per-Sender Approvals**: Each party approves the entire settlement
- **Approval Tracking**: Comprehensive approval status monitoring
- **Cancellation Rights**: Any sender can cancel before execution
- **Auto-Execution**: Optional automatic execution when all approvals received

#### Settlement Flows

- **Token Flows**: ERC20 token transfers between parties
- **External References**: Each flow now includes an `externalChainId`
  - `0` designates a local transfer executed on the current chain
  - Non-zero values record an external leg (no local transfer is attempted)
- **Approval Scope**: Only senders in local flows must provide ERC20 allowances
  and approvals
- **Validation**: Local flows are probed for ERC20 compliance; external flows
  skip token introspection

#### Hashlock Coordination

- **Shared Hashlock (`hashlock`)**: Required whenever any flow targets an
  external chain; optional for pure local settlements
- **Permissionless Reveal**: Anyone may call `revealSecret(bytes secret)` once
  the external HTLC reveals the preimage
- **Execution Gate**: Local transfers execute only after both all local
  approvals and the hashlock are satisfied
- **Auto-Execution Alignment**: Auto mode now waits for approvals _and_ a
  successful secret reveal before triggering transfers
- **Withholding Protection**: Since `revealSecret` is open to all,
  counterparties cannot block completion once the secret is public

**Use Cases:**

- Cross-chain asset swaps
- Multi-party token exchanges
- Complex financial settlements
- Atomic trade execution

**XvP Settlement Workflow:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant PartyA
    participant PartyB
    participant Settlement
    participant TokenA
    participant TokenB

    PartyA->>Settlement: Create settlement with flows
    PartyA->>Settlement: approve()
    PartyB->>Settlement: approve()

    Settlement->>Settlement: Check all approvals received
    Settlement->>TokenA: Transfer A ‚Üí B
    Settlement->>TokenB: Transfer B ‚Üí A
    Settlement->>PartyA: Settlement executed
    Settlement->>PartyB: Settlement executed
```

**Hashlock Lifecycle (for external flows):**

1. Any flow with `externalChainId != 0` requires a non-zero `hashlock` during
   creation.
2. External counterparties deploy HTLCs using the shared hashlock and eventually
   reveal the secret on their chain.
3. Anyone can relay the revealed secret via `revealSecret(bytes secret)`.
4. Execution (manual or auto) proceeds only after both the secret is accepted
   and all local approvals are present.

### 4. **Yield** (`yield/`)

Fixed yield schedule management system for token yield distribution

**Overview:** A factory system for creating and managing fixed yield schedules
that can be attached to tokens for automatic yield distribution.

**Core Features:**

- Fixed yield schedule creation
