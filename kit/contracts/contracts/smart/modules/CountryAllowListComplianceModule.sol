/// @title Country Allow-List Compliance Module
/// @author SettleMint
/// @notice This compliance module restricts token transfers *to* users unless their registered country is on an
/// approved list.
/// @dev It inherits from `AbstractCountryComplianceModule` and implements a country-based allow-list logic.
/// The module uses a token-specific list of allowed country codes provided via the `_params` argument when this
/// module is registered with a particular `ISMART` token. The format for these parameters is `abi.encode(uint16[] memory
/// allowedCountries)`.
/// A transfer *to* a recipient is PERMITTED if:
///    - The recipient has a registered identity in the token's `ISMARTIdentityRegistry` AND their country code is known
///      (not 0) AND the recipient's registered country code is present in the token-specific list of allowed countries.
/// A transfer *to* a recipient is BLOCKED if:
///    - The recipient has no identity registered in the token's `ISMARTIdentityRegistry`, or their country code is 0.
///    - OR the recipient's registered country code is not present in the token-specific list of allowed countries.
/// If any of these blocking conditions are met, the `canTransfer` function will revert with a `ComplianceCheckFailed` error,
/// effectively blocking the transfer.
/// @custom:parameters The `_params` data for this module should be ABI-encoded as a dynamic array of `uint16` country
/// codes:
///                   `abi.encode(uint16[] memory allowedCountries)`. These are the countries allowed for a specific token.

    /// The logic is as follows:
    /// 1. Retrieve the recipient's (`_to`) country code using `_getUserCountry` (from
    /// `AbstractCountryComplianceModule`).
    /// 2. If the recipient has no identity or their country code is 0, the function reverts with
    /// `ComplianceCheckFailed("Receiver identity unknown")` because this module requires known identity and country.
    /// 3. Decode the token-specific `allowedCountries` from `_params` (using `_decodeParams`).
    /// 4. Check if the recipient's country is present in this `allowedCountries` list. If yes, the transfer
    /// is allowed.
    /// 5. If the recipient has a known country and it's not in the token-specific list,
    ///    the function reverts with `ComplianceCheckFailed("Receiver country not in allowlist")`.
    /// @param _token Address of the `ISMART` token contract for which the compliance check is being performed.
    /// @param _to Address of the recipient whose country is being checked against the allow-list.
    /// @param _params ABI-encoded `uint16[]` of country codes allowed specifically for this `_token`.
