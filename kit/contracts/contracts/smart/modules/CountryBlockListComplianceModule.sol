/// @title Country Block-List Compliance Module
/// @author SettleMint
/// @notice This compliance module restricts token transfers *to* users if their registered country is on a prohibited
/// list (block-list) or if their identity/country is unknown.
/// @dev It inherits from `AbstractCountryComplianceModule` and implements a country-based block-list logic.
/// The module uses a token-specific list of blocked country codes provided via the `_params` argument when this
/// module is registered with a particular `ISMART` token. The format for these parameters is `abi.encode(uint16[] memory
/// blockedCountries)`.
/// A transfer *to* a recipient is BLOCKED (i.e., `canTransfer` reverts) if:
///    - The recipient has no identity registered in the token's `ISMARTIdentityRegistry`, or their country code is 0
///      (unknown), OR
///    - The recipient has a registered identity AND their country code is known (not 0) AND their country code is
///      present in the token-specific list of blocked countries passed via `_params`.
/// A transfer *to* a recipient is ALLOWED only if:
///    - The recipient has a registered identity AND their country code is known (not 0) AND their country code is
///      NOT present in the token-specific list of blocked countries.
/// @custom:parameters The `_params` data for this module should be ABI-encoded as a dynamic array of `uint16` country
/// codes:
///                   `abi.encode(uint16[] memory blockedCountries)`. These are the countries blocked for a specific token.

    /// It is called by the `SMARTComplianceImplementation` before a token transfer.
    /// The logic is as follows:
    /// 1. Retrieve the recipient's (`_to`) country code using `_getUserCountry` (from
    /// `AbstractCountryComplianceModule`).
    /// 2. If the recipient has no identity or their country code is 0 (unknown), the function reverts with
    /// `ComplianceCheckFailed("Receiver identity unknown")` because this module requires known identity and country.
    /// 3. Decode the token-specific `blockedCountries` from `_params` (using `_decodeParams`).
    /// 4. Check if the recipient's country is present in this `blockedCountries` list. If yes,
    ///    the transfer is blocked, and the function reverts with `ComplianceCheckFailed("Receiver country blocked")`.
    /// 5. If the recipient's country is known and not found in the block-list, the transfer is allowed by this module
    /// (function completes without reverting).
    /// @param _token Address of the `ISMART` token contract for which the compliance check is being performed.
    /// @param _to Address of the recipient whose country is being checked against the block-list.
