/// @title Interface for a SMART Fixed Yield Schedule Contract
/// @notice This interface defines the set of functions that a fixed yield schedule contract must implement.
/// A fixed yield schedule typically involves distributing a predetermined rate of yield at regular intervals over a
/// defined period.
/// This interface extends `ISMARTYieldSchedule`, inheriting its `startDate()` function, and adds many more specific
/// functions for managing and querying the fixed yield mechanism.
/// @dev Implementing contracts will manage the lifecycle of yield distribution, including calculating yield based on
/// historical balances,
/// allowing users to claim their yield, and administrative functions like topping up the underlying asset used for
/// payments.
/// Functions are `external`, meaning they are designed to be called from other contracts or off-chain applications.
/// Many are `view` functions, which read state but don't modify it.
