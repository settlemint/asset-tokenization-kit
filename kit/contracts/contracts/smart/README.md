## üìã What is SMART Protocol?

SMART Protocol is an advanced, modular smart contract framework designed for
creating regulatory-compliant security tokens and tokenizing real-world assets.
Built on multiple ERC standards, it provides a complete infrastructure for:

- **Security Token Issuance**: ERC-3643 and ERC-20 compliant tokens for
  regulated financial instruments
- **Asset Tokenization**: Bonds, equity shares, deposits, funds, and stablecoins
- **Identity Management**: On-chain KYC/AML compliance with ERC-734/735
  identities
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Modular compliance rules for different
  jurisdictions
- **DeFi Integration**: Full ERC-20 compatibility for seamless ecosystem
  integration

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

SMART Protocol consists of three main layers:

### 1. **Extension Layer**

Modular components that add specific functionality:

- **SMARTBurnable**: Token burning capabilities
- **SMARTCustodian**: Address freezing and forced transfers
- **SMARTCollateral**: Collateral proof requirements
- **SMARTPausable**: Emergency pause functionality
- **SMARTRedeemable**: Token redemption features
- **SMARTYield**: Yield/dividend distribution
- **SMARTHistoricalBalances**: Balance snapshot tracking
- **SMARTCapped**: Token supply cap
- **SMARTAccessManaged**: External access control for token operations

### 2. **System Layer**

Infrastructure contracts for identity and compliance:

- **Identity Management**: ERC-734/735 compliant on-chain identities
- **Compliance Engine**: ERC-3643 regulatory compliance validation
- **Trust Registry**: Trusted claim issuers for KYC/AML

### 3. **Compliance modules**

Compliance modules for different regulatory requirements:

- **Country Allow/Block List**: Restrict transfers to specific countries
- **Identity Allow/Block List**: Block transfers to specific identities
- **Address Block List**: Block transfers to specific addresses
- **KYC/AML**: KYC/AML compliance validation

## üîå ERC Standards Implemented

SMART Protocol implements multiple Ethereum standards to provide comprehensive
functionality:

### **ERC-20: Fungible Token Standard**

- **Full Compatibility**: Complete ERC-20 and ERC-20 Metadata implementation
- **DeFi Ready**: Works seamlessly with DEXs, lending protocols, and wallets
- **Extensions**: Transfer hooks, pausable transfers, burnable tokens
- **Upgradeability**: UUPS proxy pattern support for contract upgrades

### **ERC-3643: T-REX Security Token Standard**

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in KYC/AML and jurisdiction-specific rules
- **Transfer Restrictions**: Conditional transfers based on investor eligibility
- **Identity Verification**: Integration with trusted identity providers
- **Compliance Modules**: Pluggable rules for different regulatory requirements
- **Components**:
  - Identity Registry for investor management
  - Compliance validation engine
  - Trusted issuers registry for claim verification
  - Claim topics for required documentation types

### **ERC-734: Key Holder Standard**

- **On-chain Identity**: Self-sovereign identity management
- **Multi-purpose Keys**: Management, action, claim signing, and encryption keys
- **Execution Framework**: Multi-signature execution with key-based approval
- **Key Management**: Add, remove, and replace keys with proper authorization

### **ERC-735: Claim Holder Standard**

- **Verifiable Claims**: On-chain attestations about identity attributes
- **Trusted Issuers**: Claims validated by authorized third parties
- **Topic-based Organization**: Claims categorized by topics (KYC, nationality,
  etc.)
- **Revocation Support**: Ability to revoke outdated or invalid claims

### **ERC-2771: Meta-Transaction Standard**

- **Gasless Transactions**: Users can transact without holding ETH
- **Improved UX**: Third-party relayers can sponsor transaction costs
- **Trusted Forwarders**: Secure delegation of transaction execution
- **Native Integration**: Built into all SMART Protocol contracts

### **ERC-5313: Light Contract Ownership**

- **Access Control**: Role-based permission system
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient multi-role management
- **OpenZeppelin Integration**: Compatible with existing access control patterns

## üß© Key Highlights of SMART

- **ERC20 Compliance**: Fully implements `ERC20` and `ERC20Upgradeable`,
  ensuring compatibility with Ethereum tooling and DeFi ecosystems.
- **Externally Modular Architecture**: SMART uses composable extensions (e.g.,
  `SMARTBurnable`, `SMARTCollateral`) in a plug-and-play model.
- **Token-Configurable Compliance**: SMART tokens can be configured to use
  specific modular rules and parameters without needing custom compliance
  contracts.
- **Token-Agnostic Identity Verification**: Identity registry remains reusable
  across tokens and use cases‚Äîtokens dynamically pass required claim topics into
  the verification logic.
- **Authorization Agnostic**: SMART is compatible with any authorization logic
  via hooks (e.g., OpenZeppelin `AccessControl`).
- **ERC-2771 Meta-Transaction Support**: Compatible with trusted forwarders for
  gasless transactions and improved UX.
- **Upgradeable & Non-Upgradeable Support**: SMART supports both upgradeable
  (proxy-based) and fixed (non-upgradeable) token deployments‚Äîgiving issuers
  full control over token mutability.
- **KYC is optional**: SMART supports both regulated and unregulated assets.
  Tokens can opt into identity verification (KYC/AML) or operate
  permissionlessly‚Äîideal for both security tokens and cryptocurrencies.
- **Built-in ERC-165 Interface Detection**: Every SMART token implements
  ERC-165, allowing external systems to query which capabilities (burnable,
  redeemable, etc.) a token supports‚Äîimproving composability and tooling.
- **Two-Step Identity Recovery Flow**: If a user loses access to their wallet,
  recovery happens in two stages: first, the identity is recovered via the
  Identity Registry (by a manager); then, the user reclaims tokens tied to that
  identity‚Äîoffering secure and structured recovery.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

SMART rethinks the ERC-3643 architecture by moving modularity, configuration,
and verification closer to the token layer. This creates a more flexible,
reusable, and standards-compliant framework for compliant token issuance in
dynamic regulatory environments. By decoupling identity and compliance logic
from any single token, SMART improves scalability and opens doors for broader
cross-application identity use.
