The DvPSwap contract enables secure, atomic Delivery versus Payment (DvP) settlement between digital assets using Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC) logic.

## Why Atomic Swaps?

Atomic swaps solve the critical challenge of trust in digital asset exchanges by ensuring that either both parties receive their assets or neither does. This eliminates counterparty risk and intermediary dependence, enabling direct peer-to-peer trading with guaranteed settlement.

### Enterprise Applications:

- **Cross-Asset Settlement:** Secure settlement between different tokenized assets (securities, bonds, deposits, currencies).
- **Inter-institutional Trading:** Facilitation of trustless trading between different financial institutions.
- **OTC Trading:** Support for over-the-counter trading of digital assets with guaranteed settlement.
- **Cross-Chain Transactions:** Framework for implementing cross-chain asset exchanges when paired with complementary solutions.

- **Automated Expiry:** Enables clean-up of abandoned swaps after maximum duration.

### Maximum Transparency
