/// @title ATK Identity Proxy Contract (for Wallet Identities)
/// @author SettleMint Tokenization Services
/// @notice This contract serves as an upgradeable proxy for an individual on-chain identity associated with a user
/// wallet.
///         It is based on the ERC725 (OnchainID) standard for identity and uses ERC734 for key management.
/// @dev This proxy contract adheres to EIP-1967 for upgradeability. It holds the identity's storage (keys, claims,
/// etc.)
///      and its public address, while delegating all logic calls to a `ATKIdentityImplementation` contract.
///      The address of this logic implementation is retrieved from the central `IATKSystem` contract, allowing the
///      underlying identity logic to be upgraded without changing this proxy's address or losing its state.
///      This proxy is typically created by the `ATKIdentityFactoryImplementation`.
///      Inherits from `ATKSystemProxy`.

    /// `ATKIdentityFactory`).
    /// It initializes the proxy and the underlying identity state:
    /// 1. Stores `systemAddress` (handled by `ATKSystemProxy` constructor).
    /// 2. Validates `initialManagementKey`: Ensures it's not `address(0)`.
    /// 3. Retrieves the `ATKIdentityImplementation` address from the `IATKSystem` contract.
    /// 4. Ensures this implementation address is configured (not `address(0)`), reverting with
    /// `IdentityImplementationNotSet` if not.
    /// 5. Performs a `delegatecall` to the `initialize` function of the `Identity` contract (which
    /// `ATKIdentityImplementation` inherits) via `_performInitializationDelegatecall`.
