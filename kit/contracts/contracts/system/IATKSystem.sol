/// @dev The ATK System contract serves as the main hub and discovery point for various modules and features within

/// ATK Protocol. It allows other contracts and external users to find the addresses of crucial components like
/// compliance modules, identity registries, and their corresponding proxy contracts. These proxies are important
/// because they enable these components to be upgraded in the future without altering the addresses that other parts
/// of the system use to interact with them, ensuring stability and maintainability.
