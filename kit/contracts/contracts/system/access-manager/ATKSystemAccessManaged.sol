///         and provides internal functions for role checks and initialization.
///         Using an internal logic contract helps to avoid code duplication between
///         the standard and upgradeable versions of an extension and promotes modularity.
/// @dev This contract is not meant to be deployed directly but rather inherited by
///      `ATKSystemAccessManaged` and `ATKSystemAccessManagedUpgradeable` contracts.
///      It implements access management by delegating `hasRole` checks to the
///      configured `_accessManager`.
