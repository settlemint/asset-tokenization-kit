/// @title Interface for ATK System Access Management
/// @author SettleMint
/// @notice This interface defines the methods that must be implemented by contracts that manage access to the ATK
/// system.
///         It provides a way to check if an account has a specific role and to get the address of the access manager.
///         This interface is used to avoid code duplication between the standard and upgradeable versions of an
/// extension
///         and to promote modularity.
/// @dev This interface is not meant to be deployed directly but rather inherited by `ATKSystemAccessManaged` and
///      `ATKSystemAccessManagedUpgradeable` contracts.
///      It implements access management by delegating `hasRole` checks to the configured `_accessManager`.
interface IATKSystemAccessManaged {
    /// @notice Emitted when the access manager is set.
    /// @param sender The address that set the access manager.
    /// @param accessManager The address of the access manager.
    event AccessManagerSet(address indexed sender, address indexed accessManager);

    /// @dev Error: Account Lacks Required Role.
    ///      This error is emitted when an action is attempted by an account (`account`)
    ///      that does not possess the necessary authorization role (`neededRole`).
    ///      For example, if an account tries to perform a system operation but doesn't have the required role.
    /// @notice This error is functionally identical to `AccessControlUnauthorizedAccount`
    ///         defined in OpenZeppelin's `access/AccessControl.sol` contract.
    ///         Re-defining it here ensures consistency within the ATK framework and can
    ///         help in scenarios where specific error catching is needed for this module.
    /// @param account The address of the account that attempted the unauthorized action.
    /// @param neededRole The `bytes32` identifier of the role that the `account` was missing.
