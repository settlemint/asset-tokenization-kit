/**
 * Custodian Extension Test Suite
 *
 * WHY: Tests the custodian extension functionality which enables authorized accounts to freeze/unfreeze
 * assets for regulatory compliance, security incidents, and emergency response. The custodian extension
 * is critical for real-world asset tokenization where regulatory authorities may require immediate
 * asset freezing capabilities.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE: These tests verify that the subgraph correctly indexes custodian operations from
 * Hardhat setup scripts that execute comprehensive asset freeze scenarios across all token types
 * (deposits, bonds, equity, funds, stablecoins).
 *
 * TEST STRATEGY: Unlike simple event verification tests, these tests validate actual blockchain state
 * changes by querying indexed token balances and freeze states, ensuring the subgraph accurately
 * reflects on-chain reality rather than just event emissions.
 *
 * INTEGRATION: Tests coordinate with Hardhat scripts that execute the complete ATK transaction flow
 * (Phase 1-15 per FLOW.md), specifically focusing on Phase 9 custodian operations:
 * - setAddressFrozen() operations for complete address-level freezing (frozenInvestor)
 * - freezePartialTokens() operations for granular amount-based freezing (investorB)
 * - unfreezePartialTokens() operations for partial unfreezing scenarios
