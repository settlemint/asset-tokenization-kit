/**
 * Custodian Extension Subgraph Integration Tests
 *
 * WHY: Validates that freeze/unfreeze events are properly indexed by TheGraph subgraph,
 * ensuring regulatory compliance actions are transparently tracked and auditable.
 *
 * CRITICAL BUSINESS CONTEXT:
 * - Regulatory authorities require complete audit trails of all freeze/unfreeze actions
 * - Compliance reporting depends on accurate event indexing and balance tracking
 * - Legal proceedings need verifiable records of asset freeze/unfreeze operations
 * - Risk management systems rely on real-time freeze status data from subgraph
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE: Tests subgraph indexing of custodian events rather than direct
 * smart contract functionality, validating the compliance data pipeline.
 *
 * TRADEOFF: Integration tests depend on subgraph deployment and indexing latency
 * but provide essential validation of compliance data availability.
