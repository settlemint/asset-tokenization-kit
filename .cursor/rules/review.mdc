# Reviews

Before opening a PR, always perform a detailed review, this is the moment to
ultrathink.

## Focus on:

- Code quality and best practices (use context7 for the latest documentation)
- Consistency with with rest of the codebase
- Verify any rules defined in the .cursor/rules folder or the CLAUDE.md file are
  adhered to
- Potential bugs or issues
- Performance considerations
- Security implications
- Test coverage
- Documentation updates if needed
- Reflect on information missing, outdated or wrong in @.claude/commands
  @.cursor/rules CLAUDE.local.md and CLAUDE.md to keep improving over time.
- Compare the new code with the main branch and check if we didn't break
  anything.

### Error Handling Checklist
- ✅ All errors are logged with createLogger (no console.log)
- ✅ User-facing errors are formatted with formatValidationError
- ✅ Appropriate error boundaries are in place
- ✅ Toast notifications have proper duration settings
- ✅ Streaming mutations use useStreamingMutation hook
- ✅ Validation uses safeParse with automatic error logging

### Performance Checklist
- ✅ Performance optimizations are measured, not guessed
- ✅ URL state is used for persistent UI configuration
- ✅ Local state is used only for ephemeral interactions
- ✅ Memoization is applied only where measured as necessary
- ✅ Large lists use virtualization
- ✅ Expensive operations are debounced/throttled
- ✅ Components use stable keys (never array indices)

Provide constructive feedback with specific suggestions for improvement. Be
brutally honest, don't be a yes man. If I am wrong, point it out bluntly. I need
honest feedback on my code.

Ask me which items I want implemented, then do so step by step with a subagent
per item.
