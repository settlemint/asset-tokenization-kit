<!-- 
COMPREHENSIVE PR REVIEW PROCESS
===============================
This enhanced review process ensures high-quality code delivery and
continuous improvement of development practices. Key improvements include:

1. COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY GATES - Extended checklist covering all critical areas
2. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT - Self-reflective process to improve documentation
3. STRUCTURED FEEDBACK - Clear expectations for honest, constructive criticism
4. PARALLEL EXECUTION - Efficient implementation through sub-agent coordination

RECENT ENHANCEMENTS:
- Added documentation reflection requirement (line 21)
- Enhanced quality gates with security and performance considerations
- Structured feedback process with specific implementation workflow
- Integration with Context7 for up-to-date best practices

PURPOSE: Prevent issues before they reach production and continuously
improve our development processes through reflective analysis.

Before opening a PR, always perform a detailed review, this is the moment to ultrathink.

## Focus on:

- Code quality and best practices (use context7 for the latest documentation)
- Consistency with with rest of the codebase
- Verify any rules defined in the .cursor/rules folder or the CLAUDE.md file are
  adhered to
- Potential bugs or issues
- Performance considerations
- Security implications
- Test coverage
- Documentation updates if needed
- Reflect on information missing, outdated or wrong in @.claude/commands @.cursor/rules CLAUDE.local.md and CLAUDE.md to keep improving over time. <!-- CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT: This self-reflection requirement ensures our documentation stays current and accurate, creating a feedback loop for continuous improvement -->
- Compare the new code with the main branch and check if we didn't break
  anything.

Provide constructive feedback with specific suggestions for improvement. Be
brutally honest, don't be a yes man. If I am wrong, point it out bluntly. I need
honest feedback on my code.

Ask me which items I want implemented, then do so step by step with a subagent
per item.
