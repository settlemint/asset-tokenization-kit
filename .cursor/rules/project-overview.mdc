# Project Overview

This is the SettleMint Asset Tokenization Kit - a full-stack monorepo solution
for building digital asset platforms. It is managed by TurboRepo.

The project consists of:

- Smart contracts for various tokenized assets (bonds, equity, stablecoins,
  funds, deposits)
- A Next.js dApp with TypeScript
- A TheGraph subgraph for blockchain indexing
- Kubernetes deployment via Helm charts
- End-to-end tests using Playwright

## Key Directories

The main application code is located within the `kit` directory.

- `kit/charts/`: Contains Helm charts for deploying the application stack on
  Kubernetes. The main chart is in `[kit/charts/atk/](mdc:kit/charts/atk)`.
- `kit/contracts/`: Holds all Solidity smart contracts. This is a Hardhat
  project. Key contracts are in
  `[kit/contracts/contracts/](mdc:kit/contracts/contracts)`. Deployment scripts
  are in
  `[kit/contracts/ignition/modules/](mdc:kit/contracts/ignition/modules)`. See
  [contracts-architecture.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/contracts-architecture.mdc) for
  more details.
- `kit/dapp/`: A Next.js application that serves as the main frontend. See
  [frontend-architecture.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/frontend-architecture.mdc) for
  more details.
- `kit/subgraph/`: Contains configuration and mappings for The Graph protocol.
  The schema is defined in
  `[kit/subgraph/schema.graphql](mdc:kit/subgraph/schema.graphql)`.
- `kit/e2e/`: End-to-end tests for the platform using Playwright.
- `tools/`: Contains various utility scripts.
