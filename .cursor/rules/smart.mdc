# Contract Naming Convention: SMART vs ATK Prefixes

## Purpose
To ensure clear separation and consistent naming of protocol and implementation contracts.

## Rule
- **Directory:** `kit/contracts/contracts/smart`  
  - Contains only **SMART protocol** contracts.  
  - All contracts here **must** be prefixed with `SMART`, e.g. `SMARTGovernance.sol`.  

- **Directory:** `kit/contracts/contracts` (excluding `/smart`)  
  - Contains the **ATK implementation** of the SMART protocol.  
  - Contracts here **must not** be prefixed with `SMART`.  
  - If prefixes are used, they should be `ATK`, e.g. `ATKToken.sol`.  

This ensures that protocol contracts and implementation contracts are clearly distinguished by both directory and naming.

## Examples
- `kit/contracts/contracts/smart/SMARTGovernance.sol` ✅  
- `kit/contracts/contracts/ATKToken.sol` ✅  
- `kit/contracts/contracts/SMARTImplementation.sol` ❌ (should not use `SMART` prefix outside `/smart`)  
- `kit/contracts/contracts/smart/ATKToken.sol` ❌ (should not use `ATK` prefix inside `/smart`)
