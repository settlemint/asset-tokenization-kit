# Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a Next.js application located in `[kit/dapp/](mdc:kit/dapp/)`.

### 1. Next.js App Router

The project uses the modern Next.js App Router with server components.

- Located in `[kit/dapp/src/app/](mdc:kit/dapp/src/app/)`
- Internationalization is handled via `next-intl`.

### 2. Database

The application uses a PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM.

- Schema is defined in `[kit/dapp/src/lib/db/](mdc:kit/dapp/src/lib/db/)`.
- A Hasura GraphQL layer is used for querying.

### 3. Authentication

Authentication is managed by the Better Auth library.

- Configuration is in
  `[kit/dapp/src/lib/auth/auth.ts](mdc:kit/dapp/src/lib/auth/auth.ts)`.

### 4. Blockchain Integration

- **Viem** is used for all smart contract interactions.
- Contract addresses are managed in
  `[kit/dapp/src/lib/contracts.ts](mdc:kit/dapp/src/lib/contracts.ts)`.
- TypeScript types are generated from the contract ABIs.

### 5. State Management

- **SWR** is used for data fetching.
- **React Hook Form** is used for forms.
- Server actions are handled securely via `next-safe-action`.
