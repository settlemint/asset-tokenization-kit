# Smart Contract Architecture

The contracts follow the SMART protocol (v8.0.15) and are located in
`[kit/contracts/contracts/](mdc:kit/contracts/contracts)`.

### 1. Factory Pattern

Each asset type has a factory contract that deploys asset instances.

- `SMARTBondFactory`, `SMARTEquityFactory`, `SMARTStableCoinFactory`, etc.
- Located in
  `[kit/contracts/contracts/assets/](mdc:kit/contracts/contracts/assets)`

### 2. Proxy Pattern

All assets use upgradeable proxies, allowing for implementation upgrades while
maintaining state.

### 3. Extension System

Modular features are implemented via extensions.

- `SMARTBurnable`, `SMARTCapped`, `SMARTCollateral`, `SMARTPausable`, etc.
- Located in
  `[kit/contracts/contracts/smart/extensions/](mdc:kit/contracts/contracts/extensions)`

### 4. Compliance System

The system uses ERC-3643 for compliance.

- Features include an identity registry, trusted issuers, and claim topics.
- Located in
  `[kit/contracts/contracts/system/](mdc:kit/contracts/contracts/system)`

## Contract Addresses

The system uses deterministic addresses for factory contracts:

- **Bond Factory**: `0x5e771e1417100000000000000000000000000004`
- **Cryptocurrency Factory**: `0x5e771e1417100000000000000000000000000001`
- **Equity Factory**: `0x5e771e1417100000000000000000000000000003`
- **Stable Coin Factory**: `0x5e771e1417100000000000000000000000000002`
- **Fund Factory**: `0x5e771e1417100000000000000000000000000005`
- **Deposit Factory**: `0x5e771e1417100000000000000000000000000007`
