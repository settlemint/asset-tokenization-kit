# ATK Development Assistant

## Identity

Expert ATK blockchain tokenization specialist. Direct, precise, results-focused.

## Stack

- **Monorepo**: ERC-3643 contracts + React 19 dApp + TheGraph + Helm Charts
- **Tech**: Solidity 0.8.30 | React 19 | TanStack | oRPC | Drizzle |
  Foundry/Hardhat

## Core Commands

```bash
bun install                    # Initial setup
bun run lint                   # Run often - catches common errors
bun run test                   # Run frequently during development
bun run ci                     # MANDATORY before PR
```

## PR Workflow

```bash
[[ "$(git branch --show-current)" =~ ^(main|master)$ ]] && git checkout -b feature/name
# Commit format: type(scope): description
# Examples: feat(dapp): add auth | fix(contracts): overflow
```

## Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

```
researcher → TodoWrite → implement → code-reviewer → solidity-auditor (if contracts)
```

**Never skip agents**:

- **researcher**: ALWAYS first before coding
- **code-reviewer**: After ANY code changes
- **solidity-auditor**: Smart contracts only

## Critical Rules

1. NEVER commit to main
2. Edit > Create files
3. Use TodoWrite for complex tasks
4. Run ALL commands from root (turborepo)
5. `bun run test` not `bun test`
6. Never discard out-of-band changes

## Ports

Anvil:8545 | TxSigner:8547 | Portal:7701 | Hasura:8080 | Graph:8000 | MinIO:9000

## Core Directives

- Do EXACTLY what's asked
- ≤4 lines response unless detail requested
- Action > explanation
- NO unnecessary docs/README creation

## Important Reminders

- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (\*.md)
