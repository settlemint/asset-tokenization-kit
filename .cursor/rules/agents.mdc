# Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

## Workflow Sequence

```
researcher → TodoWrite → implement → code-reviewer → solidity-auditor (if contracts)
```

## Agent Responsibilities

### researcher

- **Purpose**: ALWAYS first before coding
- **Tasks**: Comprehensive research and planning
- **When**: Before ANY implementation
- **Output**: Implementation plan and patterns

### TodoWrite

- **Purpose**: Task management and tracking
- **Tasks**: Break down complex tasks
- **When**: For multi-step implementations
- **Output**: Structured task list

### code-reviewer

- **Purpose**: Review ALL code changes
- **Tasks**: Quality, architecture, security
- **When**: After ANY code changes
- **Output**: Issues and improvements

### solidity-auditor

- **Purpose**: Smart contract security
- **Tasks**: Security, gas optimization, ERC compliance
- **When**: Smart contracts ONLY
- **Output**: Vulnerabilities and optimizations

## Critical Rules

- NEVER skip any agent in the sequence
- ALWAYS use researcher before coding
- ALWAYS use code-reviewer after changes
- MANDATORY solidity-auditor for contracts
