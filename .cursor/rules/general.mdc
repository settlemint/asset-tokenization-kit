# General Rules

- we ONLY use Bun, NEVER suggest commands with npm, npx, yarn, pnpm, or anything else.
  - bun add
  - bunx
  - bun run

- always fix all linter warnings too, not only errors. We have a ZERO WARNING policy.
  - we especially require block statements, even for simple if and switch statements
