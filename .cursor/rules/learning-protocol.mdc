# Self-Learning Protocol

Guidelines for agent self-improvement and knowledge persistence.

## Learning Capabilities

Agents can identify and save patterns specific to your codebase:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Recurring solutions and approaches
2. **Team Preferences**: Your specific conventions and styles
3. **Common Issues**: Frequently encountered problems and fixes
4. **Tool Effectiveness**: Which MCP tools work best for different tasks

## Learning Process

1. **Discovery**: Agent identifies a useful pattern
2. **Proposal**: Agent suggests saving the learning
3. **User Approval**: You review and approve/reject
4. **Storage**: Approved learnings saved in `.claude/learnings/`
5. **Consolidation**: Periodically merged into CLAUDE.md

## What Agents Learn

### Domain-Specific Patterns

- Effective code structures for your project
- Common error patterns and solutions
- Successful refactoring approaches
- Testing strategies that work

### Tool Optimization

- Best MCP tool combinations for tasks
- Effective query patterns
- Time-saving shortcuts
- Integration workflows

### Project Conventions

- Naming patterns beyond standard conventions
- Preferred architectural approaches
- Team-specific best practices
- Common gotchas in your codebase

## Learning Storage Format

```markdown
# Learning: [Title]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD **Agent**: [agent-name] **Category**:
[pattern|convention|tool|issue]

## Context

[What situation triggered this learning]

## Learning

[The specific pattern or insight]

## Application

[How to apply this in future]

## Examples

[Code examples if applicable]
```

## Approval Guidelines

Approve learnings that:

- Save time on recurring tasks
- Prevent common mistakes
- Capture project-specific knowledge
- Improve code quality

Reject learnings that:

- Are too specific to one-off situations
- Duplicate existing documentation
- Contradict established patterns
- Add unnecessary complexity

## Integration Workflow

1. Learnings accumulate in `.claude/learnings/`
2. When 5-10 learnings exist, consolidate
3. Add consolidated patterns to relevant CLAUDE.md
4. Archive processed learning files

## Benefits

- Agents become more effective over time
- Knowledge persists across sessions
- Team patterns are preserved
- Onboarding becomes easier
- Fewer repeated mistakes
